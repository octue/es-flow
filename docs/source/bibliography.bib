Reynolds decomposition and vorticity are traditionally used; however, several other methods, including Galilean (constant convection velocity) and LES decompositions (low-pass filtering), in conjunction with critical-point analysis of the local velocity gradient tensor, reveal more about the structure of turbulence. Once the small-scale structures have been identified, it is necessary to assess their importance to the overall dynamics of the turbulence by visualizing the motions they induce and the stresses they impose both on other small-scale vortices and on the larger-scale field.},

@article{Adrian2000,
abstract = {The structure of energy-containing turbulence in the outer region of a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer has been studied using particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure the instantaneous velocity fields in a streamwise-wall-normal plane. Experiments performed at three Reynolds numbers in the range 930 {\textless} Re-{\textless}theta{\textgreater} {\textless} 6845 show that the boundary layer is densely populated by velocity fields associated with hairpin vortices. (The term `hairpin' is here taken to represent cane, hairpin, horseshoe, or omega-shaped vortices and deformed versions thereof, recognizing these structures are variations of a common basic flow structure at different stages of evolution and with varying size, age, aspect ratio, and symmetry.) The signature pattern of the hairpin consists of a spanwise vortex core located above a region of strong second-quadrant fluctuations (u {\textless} 0 and v {\textgreater} 0) that occur on a locus inclined at 30-60 degrees to the wall. In the outer layer, hairpin vortices occur in streamwise-aligned packets that propagate with small velocity dispersion. Packets that begin in or slightly above the buffer layer are very similar to the packets created by the autogeneration mechanism (Zhou, Adrian {\&} Balachandar 1996). Individual packets grow upwards in the streamwise direction at a mean angle of approximately 12 degrees, and the hairpins in packets are typically spaced several hundred viscous lengthscales apart in the streamwise direction. Within the interior of the envelope the spatial coherence between the velocity fields induced by the individual vortices leads to strongly retarded streamwise momentum, explaining the zones of uniform momentum observed by Meinhart {\&} Adrian (1995). The packets are an important type of organized structure in the wall layer in which relatively small structural units in the form of three-dimensional vortical structures are arranged coherently, i.e. with correlated spatial relationships, to form much longer structures. The formation of packets explains the occurrence of multiple VITA events in turbulent `bursts', and the creation of Townsend's (1958) large-scale inactive motions. These packets share many features of the hairpin models proposed by Smith (1984) and co-workers for the near-wall layer, and by Bandyopadhyay (1980), but they are shown to occur in a hierarchy of scales across most of the boundary layer. In the logarithmic layer, the coherent vortex packets that originate close to the wall frequently occur within larger, faster moving zones of uniform momentum, which may extend up to the middle of the boundary layer. These larger zones are the induced interior how of older packets of coherent hairpin vortices that originate upstream and over-run the younger, more recently generated packets. The occurence of small hairpin packets in the environment of larger hairpin packets is a prominent feature of the logarithmic layer. With increasing Reynolds number, the number of hairpins in a packet increases.},

Above the viscous wall layer, the hairpin vortex paradigm of Theodorsen coupled with the quasistreamwise vortex paradigm have gained considerable support from multidimensional visualization using particle image velocimetry and direct numerical simulation experiments. Hairpins can autogenerate to form packets that populate a significant fraction of the boundary layer, even at very high Reynolds numbers. The dynamics of packet formation and the ramifications of organization of coherent structures (hairpins or packets) into larger-scale structures are discussed. Evidence for a large-scale mechanism in the outer layer suggests that further organization of packets may occur on scales equal to and larger than the boundary layer thickness.

In this paper, uncertainties regarding the time series length used to characterize a certain wave state, uncertainties related to the JONSWAP spectrum parameters and the influence on wave state discretization in a scatter diagram are assessed. The estimated uncertainties are then implemented in two generic structural reliability assessments with focus on fatigue and extreme failure modes. The resulting reliability indices are compared with related industries like offshore wind turbines. This paper focus on the Wavestar prototype for reliability assessments.

The acoustic near field is simulated directly by LES whereas the far field is modeled using acoustic analogy. Due to the fine grid employed, smallest eddy scales near the blade surface are resolved. Aerodynamic performance and acoustic emissions are predicted for the actual tip shape and an ogee type tip shape. A decrease of the sound pressure level in the high frequency domain is observed for the ogee type tip shape.

At this purpose, a high resolution wave energy atlas and a 10 year WAM dataset presented recently [1] for the Mediterranean Sea are utilized. The dataset is applied to identify some rich (energy-wise) areas along the Italian coasts. The wave data are analysed at certain locations, by obtaining the directional distribution (wave climate in deep water). Then, they are propagated to intermediate water for estimating the wave energy along the coast, by including the wave shoaling and refraction effect. Finally, the data in intermediate water (local wave climate) are investigated from the perspective of a wave energy device: the average annual wave power is analysed and the extreme waves are estimated to obtain the return value of extreme storms. The latter information is quite useful to obtain the design wave. The computations are performed via the numerical code MIKE 21, and the Extreme Value Analysis is pursued via the Equivalent Power Storm (EPS) model [2].},

abstract = {Resource assessments for marine renewable energy are commonly provided by a combination of wave measurement and modelling. For most sites, a long-term wave data set is not available. Instead, wave model output is validated against shortterm wave measurements, or those taken nearby. A hindcast is then used to give an extended data set, allowing a statistically robust assessment of the wave climate at the site. Often, these models will not effectively resolve intra-site variability. This paper describes analysis of the spatial properties of ocean waves at a marine renewables site scale. This draws on unique measurements from an array of four directional wave buoys installed in a square formation, with side 500m, in the Celtic Sea, UK, and a high spatial resolution spectral wave model covering the same site. Here we show that the both the measurements and the model predict differences in the wave climate within the site. These results highlight the importance of intra-site variability for marine renewable energy and suggest that high spatial resolution spectral wave models, perhaps nested into a larger model domain, have the potential to provide a data set for the prediction of spatial variability of wave conditions across a marine renewable energy site.},

abstract = {To investigate the accuracy of tomographic particle image velocimetry (Tomo-PIV) for turbulent boundary layer measurements, a series of synthetic image-based simulations and practical experiments are performed on a high Reynolds number turbulent boundary layer at Re(theta) = 7,800. Two different approaches to Tomo-PIV are examined using a full-volume slab measurement and a thin-volume (fat) light sheet approach. Tomographic reconstruction is performed using both the standard MART technique and the more efficient MLOS-SMART approach, showing a 10-time increase in processing speed. Random and bias errors are quantified under the influence of the near-wall velocity gradient, reconstruction method, ghost particles, seeding density and volume thickness, using synthetic images. Experimental Tomo-PIV results are compared with hot-wire measurements and errors are examined in terms of the measured mean and fluctuating profiles, probability density functions of the fluctuations, distributions of fluctuating divergence through the volume and velocity power spectra. Velocity gradients have a large effect on errors near the wall and also increase the errors associated with ghost particles, which convect at mean velocities through the volume thickness. Tomo-PIV provides accurate experimental measurements at low wave numbers; however, reconstruction introduces high noise levels that reduces the effective spatial resolution. A thinner volume is shown to provide a higher measurement accuracy at the expense of the measurement domain, albeit still at a lower effective spatial resolution than planar and Stereo-PIV.},

abstract = {To date, Tomo-PIV has involved the use of the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique (MART), where the intensity of each 3D voxel is iteratively corrected to satisfy one recorded projection, or pixel intensity, at a time. This results in reconstruction times of multiple hours for each velocity field and requires considerable computer memory in order to store the associated weighting coefficients and intensity values for each point in the volume. In this paper, a rapid and less memory intensive reconstruction algorithm is presented based on a multiplicative line-of-sight (MLOS) estimation that determines possible particle locations in the volume, followed by simultaneous iterative correction. Reconstructions of simulated images are presented for two simultaneous algorithms (SART and SMART) as well as the now standard MART algorithm, which indicate that the same accuracy as MART can be achieved 5.5 times faster or 77 times faster with 15 times less memory if the processing and storage of the weighting matrix is considered. Application of MLOS-SMART and MART to a turbulent boundary layer at Re $\theta$ = 2200 using a 4 camera Tomo-PIV system with a volume of 1,000 × 1,000 × 160 voxels is discussed. Results indicate improvements in reconstruction speed of 15 times that of MART with precalculated weighting matrix, or 65 times if calculation of the weighting matrix is considered. Furthermore the memory needed to store a large weighting matrix and volume intensity is reduced by almost 40 times in this case.},

abstract = {Time domain (phase resolved) and spectral (phase averaged) wave models are the usual numerical tools for studying wave climate evolution, coastal processes and environmental impacts at regional scale. However, it is not straightforward to model a WEC or a WEC array in such models. At present there have been attempts in which the WECs are modelled as sinks and sources coefficients, these coefficients having been calibrated empirically. This method only partially addresses the underlying physics. In contrast, this paper presents a method which is seen as superior because it addresses better the problem, particularly in case of oscillating WECs or OWCs. The method couples the BEM approach and phase resolved or phase averaged approaches. It makes use of far field coefficients from BEM (also know as the Kochin function) which can be integrated in wave propagation models. First, the theory for the calculation of the far field coefficients is recalled as well as the underlying assumptions. Then, a methodology for coupling with phase resolved wave models is proposed. It makes use of domain decomposition. Comparison of results obtained with the proposed coupled method with direct approach shows excellent agreement, which confirms the potential of the method. Eventually, a methodology for coupling with spectral wave models is envisaged.},

abstract = {It is well known in the literature that the total absorbed energy of a farm of wave energy converter depends, within a wide range of variability, on the hydrodynamic interaction between the individual devices. Several studies have addressed the problem of controlling the wave energy converters so as to exploit the positive interaction between the devices in order to increase the total amount of absorbed energy. This paper studies two types of control systems for array of wave energy converters: the first is similar to the classical optimal control which uses the complete (linear) hydrodynamic model of the array and information about the status (velocity) of the other devices, while the second is a suboptimal control systems which calculates the optimal motion while neglecting completely the interaction between the devices. Most importantly the comparison is carried out considering the effects of constraints on the maximum allowed oscillation amplitude and PTO force. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Marine currents can carry large amounts of energy, largely driven by the tides, which are a consequence of the gravitational effects of the planetary motion of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun. Augmented flow velocities can be found where the underwater topography (bathymetry) in straits between islands and the mainland or in shallows around headlands plays a major role in enhancing the flow velocities, resulting in appreciable kinetic energy. At some of these sites where practical flows are more than 1 m s(-1), marine current energy conversion is considered to be economically viable. This study describes the salient issues related to the exploitation of marine currents for electricity production, resource assessment, the conversion technologies and the status of leading projects in the field. This study also summarizes important issues related to site development and some of the approaches currently being undertaken to inform device and array development. This study concludes that, given the highlighted commitments to establish favourable regulatory and incentive regimes as well as the aspiration for energy independence and combating climate change, the progress to multi-megawatt arrays will be much faster than that achieved for wind energy development.},

abstract = {Tidal stream power generation represents a promising source of renewable energy. In order to extract an economically useful amount of power, tens to hundreds of tidal turbines need to be placed within an array. The layout of these turbines can have a significant impact on the power extracted and hence on the viability of the site. Funke et al. formulated the question of the best turbine layout as an optimisation problem constrained by the shallow water equations and solved it using a local, gradient-based optimisation algorithm. Given the local nature of this approach, the question arises of how optimal the layouts actually are. This becomes particularly important for scenarios with complex bathymetry and layout constraints, both of which typically introduce locally optimal layouts. Optimisation algorithms which find the global optima generally require orders of magnitude more iterations than local optimisation algorithms and are thus infeasible in combination with an expensive flow model. This paper presents an analytical wake model to act as an efficient proxy to the shallow water model. Based upon this, a hybrid global-local two-stage optimisation approach is presented in which turbine layouts are first optimised with the analytical wake model via a global optimisation algorithm, and further optimised with the shallow water model via a local gradient-based optimisation algorithm. This procedure is applied to a number of idealised cases and a more realistic case with complex bathymetry in the Pentland Firth, Scotland. It is shown that in cases where bathymetry is considered, the two-stage optimisation procedure is able to improve the power extracted from the array by as much as 25{\%} compared to local optimisation for idealised scenarios and by as much as 12{\%} for the more realistic Pentland Firth scenario whilst in many cases reducing the overall computation time by approximately 35{\%}.},

abstract = {Various global studies have shown that marine currents have large potential as a predictable sustainable resource for commercial scale generation of electrical power. For successful exploitation of this resource, an understanding of the hydrodynamics of the marine current turbine is of primary importance. Although a lot can be learned from the technology transfer from wind turbines and ship propellers, there has been limited hydrodynamics research for this particular application. A methodology is presented for the hydrodynamic design of horizontal axis marine current turbines. Recent research has investigated the performance of suitable 2D section shapes both experimentally in a cavitation tunnel and with numerical simulations. A numerical model of a typical 3D rotor is used to demonstrate parametric variations of the design parameters and the use of alternative blade sections. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The development of a blade element momentum (BEM) model for the hydrodynamic design of marine current turbines is presented. The model includes routines for interpolation of 2D section data and extrapolation for stall delay. The numerical model is compared with experimental data obtained from tests of an 800 mm diameter model rotor carried out in a cavitation tunnel. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the experiments. Using this validated model, a typical 3D rotor is used to demonstrate parametric variations of the design parameters. The effect of tip immersion on possible cavitation is assessed for this rotor. The model is then used to solve the dynamic effects of a tidal profile. The effect of an increase in blade roughness is presented, indicating a relatively small reduction in power. This work demonstrates that the numerical model developed can provide a useful tool for the investigation of the hydrodynamic design and operation of marine current turbines.

abstract = {The specific speed (type number) is a characteristic number of fluid flow machines, which is based upon their design parameters. Specific speed widely serves as an indicator of selecting and designing conventional turbines, such as Kaplan turbines. It is also common to design tidal turbines in using theories that were originally developed for wind turbines. In so doing, only characteristic numbers of wind turbines are calculated, however not their specific speed. Nevertheless, tidal turbines are fluid flow machines too. Thus comparisons between their specific speed and that of other fluid flow turbines are possible but have yet to be done. In analysing the performance of tidal turbines and concepts thereof, this article calculates the specific speed and other characteristic numbers. The results are compared to those of conventional turbines as well as wind turbines and then integrated to conventional diagrams. It can be shown that tidal turbines are associated with high values of specific speed so that their data lies outside the range of conventional diagrams. Compared to wind turbines, the specific speed of tidal turbines is high too, although not as high as that of wind turbines. This article closes in indicating that numerous tidal turbines, whose design is based on wind turbines, should be indeed designed with higher values of specific speed. Diagrams of specific speed for conventional turbines should be extended to further integrate tidal turbines. Keywords},

The framework is composed of a computational fluid dynamics library coupled with blade element momentum theory and time-accurate Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. The paper explores: (i) effect of computational grid density on wake development predictions, (ii) effect of buoyancy force on blade deflections, (iii) quasi-steady inflow and (iv) a stepwise tidal-gust effects on the deflection level of different types of blades. It is revealed that (i) tuned flexibility of a blade may contribute performance increase, (ii) buoyancy force makes edgewise loading of a rotating blade less severe (iii) the level of static and dynamic flapwise deflection of tip of a blade is likely the highest as the dynamic edgewise oscillation frequency is higher than those of others and (iv) blade deformation changes wake structures.

abstract = {This study demonstrates that a pulsed wind lidar is a reliable instrument for measuring angles between horizontal vectors of significance in the atmospheric boundary layer. Three different angles are considered: the wind turning, the angle between the stress vector and the mean wind direction, and the angle between the stress vector and the vertical gradient of the mean velocity vector. The latter is assumed to be zero by the often applied turbulent-viscosity hypothesis, so that the stress vector can be described through the vertical gradient of velocity. In the atmospheric surface layer, where the Coriolis force is negligible, this is supposedly a good approximation. High-resolution large-eddy simulation data show that this is indeed the case even beyond the surface layer. In contrast, through analysis of WindCube lidar measurements supported by sonic measure- ments, the study shows that it is only valid very close to the surface. The deviation may be significant even at 100 m. This behavior is attributed to mesoscale effects. 1.},

abstract = {The technology of Voith Hydro's HyTide{\textregistered} tidal current turbine relies on simplicity and robustness. This approach results in a technical solution omitting a yaw and pitch system and therefore has a need for a special design of the rotor blades. The rotor blade itself is designed symmetrically to allow power conversion in both directions with the same efficiency. The effects of passive rotor modifications are investigated to improve and influence the rotor characteristic to reduce power in higher than rated current velocities operation ranges and at the same time keep a wide and efficient maximum. This aims to reduce the turbines fatigue loading and to fit into given boundary conditions for different installation sites. Therefore Voith Hydro is investigating different approaches of rotor modifications by using analytical (blade element momentum method (BEM)), numerical (Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)) and experimental (gathered model data) methods.

abstract = {Tidal flows suitable for the installation of tidalstream turbines are highly turbulent with a broad range of turbulent scales, and intensities of around 10{\%}. It is important to understand how turbulent flows affect the performance and wake profiles for the accurate prediction of the performance of single devices and arrays. Previous studies have considered the effects of turbulence intensity, but the effects of turbulent eddy size have not been investigated. This paper presents a new method for generating turbulence in large eddy simulations of uniform actuator disc rotor models. The advantage of the gridded actuator disc is that the generated turbulence may be controlled, so the effects of turbulence length scale and intensity may be investigated. Initial results show the wake recovery is faster behind a rotor generating larger turbulent length scales and intensities, with a corresponding increase in axial induction and thrust. Therefore turbines may be positioned closer together if they generate more turbulence, increasing the power output of an array for a given area, although the individual device performance may be lower. Future work will consider the effects of free-stream turbulence on the performance and wake profiles of the gridded actuator disc, and validation against experimental data.},

Some relevant software already existed and few additional components were required, which have been developed mainly by students and are available at ftp.lfa.mw.tum.de. The geometry of turbomachine blades is described with a newly developed NURBS based blade designer. One-dimensional preliminary analysis is done with OpenOffice.org Calc and an extended mean line program, where loss models are already included. For two-dimensional through-flow computations a compressible streamline curvature method was implemented. Two-dimensional blade-to-blade and three-dimensional simulations are performed with the CFD toolbox OpenFOAM. The two- and three-dimensional results are visualized and analyzed using the open source postprocessing tool ParaView. The presented tools are regularly used in student projects. A generic one stage axial compressor was created with the workflow as a showcase in order to demonstrate the capabilities of the open source software tools.},

abstract = {Recent developments in LIDAR technology have led to a great deal of interest in the possibility of improving turbine control by making use of a turbine-mounted Lidar system to sense the approaching wind field before it reaches the turbine, providing preview information which might help the controller to improve turbine performance. This could significantly reduce the loads on the turbine, leading to improved cost-effectiveness, especially for large turbines. There have also been some claims of direct increases in energy capture as a result of using such preview information. Simulation models are a vital tool for assessing these claims, for developing control algorithms which can make use of the Lidar signal, and to help Lidar developers optimise their systems for this application. Current simulation models make use of Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis, but this is not strictly valid when Lidar is used to measure wind speeds upstream of the turbine, as the measured wind cannot be assumed to convect unchanged to the turbine. In this paper, a method for avoiding the frozen turbulence assumption is proposed, and some simulation results are presented to illustrate the effect this might have on the fatigue load reductions which could be achieved using Lidar-assisted control. The paper also discusses some issues surrounding the possibility of extreme load reduction by using Lidar to sense approaching gusts. The standard specifications for extreme gusts should be reviewed if Lidar preview information is to be used by the controller.},

abstract = {This study examines the performance of an improved 5-beam ADCP, with a vertical beam, when deployed to measure non-directional waves in waters of 40m depth. To assess the performance, the ADCP is compared with four co-located directional wave buoys. The surface elevation spectra as measured by the vertical beam compare well with estimates from the buoys in the range 0.10–0.35Hz. Except for peak period, spectral estimates of wave height, mean energy period and spectral bandwidth from the vertical beam agree well with estimates from the buoys, showing only small differences of 2–7{\%}. Some cases exist where either the ADCP or the buoys can resolve particular wave systems that the other sensor cannot resolve, though some of these instances may be the result of numerical artefact. At low frequencies, the ADCP shows a better sensitivity to swell components, and though the buoys can produce low frequency peaks, the difference between the two sensors is particularly evident during low energy sea states. At high frequencies, both sensors may show susceptibility to noise. The study intends to increase the level of confidence in using a 5-beam ADCP with a vertical beam, and of its comparative performance with a different wave sensor.},

Predictions are shown underestimate wave pressure loads, and other methods subsequently developed are presented. A simplistic experimental method taking in consideration variations of the wetted surface area of the flap is shown to lead to relatively good estimates of wave pressure loads that could be used for fatigue calculations.},

abstract = {Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) is a method of modelling the performance of wind, current or tidal turbines. It is split into two parts, one dimensional momentum theory with rotational momentum and blade element theory. When modelling the turbines out of the normal operating range the most commonly used convergence method of the BEMT expressions for the axial thrust and rotational torque is shown to be problematic. An alternative, more robust, scheme is discussed which is based on a combined Monte Carlo and sequential quadratic optimisation of the derived BEMT equations. Tip and hub losses are considered and Prandtl's corrections are implemented. These corrections are compared to other tip and hub loss methods and for differing angles of incoming flow. The torque, axial force and power coefficients found using this method are compared to a lifting line theory model and another BEMT code for various Tip Speed Ratios. It is shown that the method, with tip and hub losses, agree well with the alternative BEMT scheme. Both these programs predict consistently higher values than the lifting line theory method as this, more conservative, approach accounts for the three dimensional flow effects such as the radial flow created by the rotation of the blades.},

abstract = {A resistive control strategy to optimize pneumatic power for a floating OWC device is presented. This strategy utilizes a linear, frequency-domain performance model that links an oscillating structure to air-pressure fluctuations with a Wells Turbine in 3-dimensions. An array of field points defining the interior free surface allows hydrodynamic parameters relating to the fluctuating air-pressure within the OWC to be calculated using reciprocity relations. Device structural parameters for a non-optimized BBDB are detailed and the performance model is exercised on this device. A new resonance results from coupling the floating structure to the air-column that is unique from the uncoupled resonance location. An analytic expression for the optimal resistive load to link the floating structure and aircolumn dynamics is presented. When the optimal resistive load is exercised within the model, the natural resonances of the coupled system are preserved and additional linked peaks are identified. This formulation of the optimal resistive load is shown to contribute significantly to the device capture width and power performance.},

This case study is used to give an insight into the marine consenting process; from the initial application for a seabed lease from the Crown Estate, through to the preparation of an Environmental Statement after consultation with the Marine Management Organisation (MMO). The paper details the requirements for the scoping stage of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, looking at the topics covered in the Scoping Report for PTEC. It summarises the environmental baseline data for the report as well as the additional studies needed to satisfy an Environmental Statement (ES). Other essential features of the scoping stage, such as the development and successful implementation of a robust Stakeholder Engagement Plan as well as the use of Rochdale Envelopes in similar marine renewable developments are discussed.},

abstract = {The design process of a device for energy harvesting from sea waves is a complex task, which involves many different stages ranging from the initial mathematical models to an extensive field testing. Scale models are a crucial tool to asses the real world device performance and to validate the mathematical models used in the design process. This paper describes the first laboratory campaign of the scale model of an Inertial Sea Wave Energy Converter (ISWEC). The experiments were carried out in the wave tank of INSEAN (The Italian ship model basin, Rome) between February and April 2012. ISWEC uses a gyroscope to create an internal inertial reaction able to harvest wave power without exposing mechanical parts to the harsh oceanic environment. As for other WECs, the theoretically optimal control of ISWEC should be able to adjust the dynamic parameters of the PTO, such as the spring constant and energy absorbing damping, to maximize the energy absorption. The aim of this manuscript is to explore the effect of PTO control parameters on energy production for a given incoming wave.},

An informed, and accurate, characterisation of the wave energy resource is an essential aspect of this process. Ireland is exposed to an energetic wave climate, however many features of this resource are not well understood. This paper utilizes metocean datasets that have previously been unavailable for exposed Irish sites to investigate some interesting characterises the wave energy resource at the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS), a facility for conducting sea trials of floating wave energy converters that is being developed near Belmullet, on the west coast of Ireland. Previous work by the authors has provided summaries of the wave climate at the site and how is varies over seasonal and interannual timeframes. Here a number of commonly made assumptions in the calculation of wave power are contested, and the uncertainties resulting from their application are demonstrated. The relationship between commonly used wave period parameters is studied, and its importance in the calculation of wave power quantified. Additionally, observations of the extreme wave conditions that have occurred at the site and estimates of future storms that devices will need to withstand are presented. The implications of these results for the design and operation of wave energy converters are discussed. The foremost contribution of this paper is the development of an enhanced understanding of the fundamental nature of the wave energy resource at the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site. The results presented here also have a wider relevance, and can be considered typical of other, similarly exposed, locations on Ireland's west coast.},

By using the dual singular and an extra cut-off function, we are able
to derive a new extraction formula for lambda in terms of w and, hence,
deduce a well-posed variational problem for w. Standard continuous
piecewise linear finite element approximation yields O(h) optimal
accuracy for w, which, in turn, implies the same accuracy for u in the

the selectivity property of the wavelet transform and permits the

with structures and therefore the typical length-scale. The procedure
is validated by the application to velocity vector fields obtained from
PIV measurements in different flow conditions and turbulence levels.
Results are compared with those obtained by other more standard

Of particular concern are marine mammals that are already facing threats from other human activities as well as climate change.

This study determined a “worst case” scenario for interaction between a marine mammal and a tidal turbine, focusing on the highly endangered Southern Resident Killer Whale in the U.S. and an open-centred tidal turbine (OpenHydro) proposed for deployment. The analysis combined a finite element modelling of the forces from the turbine blade with information on the biomechanical analysis of the marine mammal tissues, in order to estimate the potential results of a blade strike. Supported by ancillary data, this analysis is being used to inform permitting of a tidal energy project in Puget Sound, Washington, U.S. Analyses are underway to further develop this and related analyses to include three tidal turbine designs and three marine mammal species.},

abstract = {The wave termination potential of a Cycloidal Wave Energy Converter is investigated by means of its wave generation characteristics. This is achieved by modelling a two dimensional hydrofoil rotating near a free surface using unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulation. A grid refinement study is simultaneously completed using a coarse, medium and fine mesh at pitch angles of 0° and 10°. The study found that a medium sized mesh captures critical wave generation properties while minimizing computational requirements. The optimal mesh is then implemented at pitch angles of -10°, -5°, and 5°. For all simulations the hydrofoil generates a significant one-sided wave field consisting of a primary wave and its harmonics. The fundamental wave has a period equal to the device period and its amplitude increases linearly with pitch angle. A key difference between previous inviscid and the current URANS results is that these simulations are able to predict the detailed viscous flow field around the hydrofoil and resulting hydrodynamic forces for a fixed pitch angle. A decrease in outward radial force and an increase in tangential force were noted as the hydrofoil passed near the free surface for all cases. The hydrofoil surface pressure distribution varied significantly with circumferential position due to interactions with the free surface for positive pitch angles.},

abstract = {The paper presents an analysis of the mooring system effects on the dynamics of an arbitrary floating wave energy converter (WEC) and on the efficiency of the device. The mooring system dynamics are calculated by a finite differences method, which accounts for the lines' physical characteristics such as mass and stiffness, as well as for the hydrodynamic inertial and damping characteristics. A method is proposed and applied to consider the inertial, damping and stiffness effects of the mooring system on the WEC's linear dynamics. An identification method is used to determine the linear mooring system coefficients from pre-calculated nonlinear time domain forces of the mooring system on the floater (the importance of nonlinear effects is assessed as well). Finally the mooring system dynamics is represented by additional inertial, damping and stiffness matrices which are added to the ones of the WEC. The influence of the mooring system on the WEC dynamics and efficiency is assessed in terms of wave induced motions and absorbed power. Results are presented for the transfer functions, statistics in selected stationary sea states and the expected annual absorbed energy. A wave scatter diagram representative of the Portuguese Pilot Zone is used for the annual predictions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A wave energy converter (WEC) in an array interacts with another WEC and performs differently in average than an isolated WEC does. How the array interaction affects the performances of individual WECs therefore becomes an important issue to be studied. We start with two identical bottom-hinged flapper WEC models operating in tandem instead of directly attacking the much more complicated array problem. Hydraulic pumps are used as the power take-off (PTO) to the whole system and their forcing characteristics as an energy damper are determined using a weight-pulley platform. The performances of these two WECs at separation distance varying from 0.5$\lambda$ to $\lambda$ (wavelength) with increment of $\lambda$/16 are measured using two high-speed digital cameras to image WECs oscillating in tandem in a well-controlled wave basin. The motion characteristics of each WEC are obtained by analyzing the time series of images in order to evaluate the capture factor of the WEC. The test results indicate that the capture factors of the two WECs depend on the separation distance between them and 3D effect is significant.},

We first establish the notion of nocuous ambiguities, which are those that are likely to lead to misunderstandings. We test our approach on coordination ambiguities, which occur when words such as and or are used. Our starting point is a dataset of ambiguous phrases from a requirements corpus and associated human judgements about their interpretation. We then use heuristics, based largely on word distribution information, to automatically replicate these judgements. The heuristics eliminate ambiguities which people interpret easily, leaving the nocuous ones to be analysed and rewritten by hand. We report on a series of experiments that evaluate our heuristics' performance against the human judgements. Many of our heuristics achieve high precision, and recall is greatly increased when they are used in combination},

The more general equation governing the optimum is derived and an integral relation is obtained, stating that the optimum solution satisfies the minimum energy condition of Betz in the Trefftz plane “in the average”. The discretization of the problem is detailed, including the viscous correction based on the 2-D viscous profile data. A constraint is added to account for the force on the tower. The minimization problem is solved very efficiently by relaxation. Several optimized solutions are calculated and compared with the NREL rotor, using the same profile, but different chord and twist distributions.

abstract = {In this paper, a modified third generation spectral wave solver (TOMAWAC) is used to model the power absorption and evolution of wave energy spectra across wave farms. This, unlike many other solvers, has the advantage of being able to consider variable site bathymetry, wave absorption and some nonlinear wave processes in an acceptable computational time frame. This paper presents comparisons between numerical estimates and tank test results, conducted as part of the PerAWaT project. The experiments addressed the performance of large arrays of point absorber WECs (up to 24 units) and were performed with 1:80 scale models at Queen's University Belfast (QUB). Numerical simulations were also conducted with a frequency-domain model in order to verify the results derived from the spectral solver. Comparisons between numerical predictions and experimental results for a variety of wave conditions and different array layouts are presented. Key performance variables such as absorbed power per sea state for each WEC as well as overall ‘interaction factor' are considered. Hydrodynamic array interactions were found experimentally to cause losses of up to 26{\%} in energy yield, compared to WECs operating in isolation. The spectral-domain model predicts losses reasonably well although the comparison is expected to improve under more realistic conditions.},

abstract = {The turbulent boundary layer is an aspect of fluid flow which dominates the performance of many engineering systems - yet the analytic solution of such flows is intractable for most applications. Our understanding of boundary layers is therefore limited by our ability to simulate and measure them.
Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TPIV) is a recently developed technique for direct measurement of fluid velocity within a 3D region. This allows new insight into the topological structure of turbulent boundary layers.
Increasing Reynolds Number increases the range of scales at which turbulence exists; a measurement technique must have a larger 'dynamic range' to fully resolve the flow. Tomographic PIV is currently limited in spatial dynamic range (which is also linked to the spatial and temporal resolution) due to a high degree of noise. Results also contain significant bias error.
This work proposes a modification of the technique to use more than two exposures in the PIV process, which (for four exposures) is shown to improve random error by a factor of 2 to 7 depending on experimental setup parameters. The dynamic range increases correspondingly and can be doubled again in highly turbulent flows. Bias error is reduced by up to 40{\%}.
An alternative reconstruction approach is also presented, based on application of a reduction strategy (elimination of coefficients based on a first guess) to the tomographic weightings matrix Wij. This facilitates a potentially significant increase in computational efficiency.
Despite the achieved reduction in error, measurements contain non-zero divergence due to noise and sampling errors. The same problem affects visualisation of topology and coherent fluid structures. Using Projection Onto Convex Sets, a framework for post-processing operators is implemented which includes a divergence minimisation procedure and a scale-limited denoising strategy which is resilient to 'false' vectors contained in the data.
Finally, developed techniques are showcased by visualisation of topological information in the inner region of a high Reynolds Number boundary layer ($\delta$+ = 1890, Re$\theta$ = 3650). Comments are made on the visible flow structures and tentative conclusions are drawn.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the simple case of the turbulent boundary layer in a constant pressure field and considers the complex problem of the effects of pressure gradients, and variable wall roughness. The concepts of boundary layer phenomena, in general, and turbulent boundary layers, in particular, have found application in a wide range of fields including aeronautics, guided missiles, marine engineering, hydraulics, meteorology, oceanography, chemical engineering, atomic reactors, and the flow of liquids and gases in the human body. Many ideas for turbulent boundary layers involve assumptions other than those for turbulent shear stresses and in these cases, the validity of the results is examined first for laminar layers and then interpreted in the light of the possible shear stress patterns of turbulent layers. The effect of roughness on boundary layer characteristics is examined in the chapter. The wall is aerodynamically smooth for a turbulent boundary layer if the roughness elements are so small as to be buried in the laminar sublayer. Pressure gradients, Reynolds number, or roughness does not affect the constants of proportionality. The assumption of a constant outer viscosity has been investigated only for the case of equilibrium layers.},

abstract = {Results of performance and loading from numerical simulations performed with GL Garrad Hassan's tidal turbine modelling tool, Tidal Bladed, are compared to measured data from Tidal Generation Limited's 500kW tidal turbine. The mean simulated values of key parameters such as electrical power, rotor speed, pitch angle and blade near-root flapwise bending moment agree well with the measured data. The minimum and maximum values of these indicators are found to be more extreme for simulations than for measured data. This difference is largely attributed to the uncertainty in the definition of the turbulent flow field. Blade root fatigue load predictions by Tidal Bladed are found to be conservative compared to the measured data. The major contributor to measured fatigue load is flow turbulence. Extreme loading under normal power production is also found to be conservative. Keywords—},

@article{Colucci2013,
abstract = {This paper looks at two aspects based on field data gathered by a single ADCP: 1) in situ characterisation of the wave and current fields at a wave energy site, and 2) a preliminary investigation into their interaction. A Teledyne RDI 5-beam ADCP with a vertical beam was used to record simultaneous measurements of waves and currents at 2Hz over the period of 2010-2011 at the UK's Wave Hub site where the water depth is 40m. It is found that the vertical beam accurately measures wave spectra up to high frequencies as well as providing directional wave data. Plots of wave parameters are presented for the deployment. The current velocity field exhibits bi-directional behaviour between ebb and flood phases. A preliminary investigation into the interaction of waves and currents at such a relatively deep site is undertaken and the methodology described. It is found that linear wave theory is applicable at the site, but collected data has proved difficult to notice important interactions. Some initial results are presented for the effects of waves on currents and for the effects of currents on waves. Some correlation was seen between the changes in the wave height according to the phase of the tide while the mean current profiles can be affected by the wave induced Stokes drift velocity. Even initial field data results like the ones presented in this paper are vital for future design and demonstration of wave energy converters. Despite inconclusive findings and the need for further study, a methodology for investigating wave current interactions from ADCP field data at a relatively deep site is presented.},

Many inconsistencies are shown to have existed in earlier presentations and reviews, particularly with respect to quantifying the power indices and turbulence intensities appropriate to rougher terrains, and the variation of the turbulence length scales with height and terrain type. These are resolved by defining from the data four distinct terrain types. The variation of the power index, turbulence intensity and Reynolds stresses with these terrain types is shown to follow the same law. It is also shown that the longitudinal length scale of turbulence decreases with increase of terrain roughness: a simple law is also proposed for its variation with both height and terrain type.},

When assessing a site's suitability for installation of offshore renewable generation, the risk of non-completion of maintenance activities due to inaccessibility, and the impact of the potential inactive ‘waiting' time must be factored into the decision criteria. In this study, suitable sites were selected for analysis and data extracted from a ten-year hindcast providing concurrent, colocated hourly wind and wave conditions. The fraction of hours accessible in each month was calculated, along with average window duration and waiting time. Both occurrence and persistence of conditions were found to be seasonally variable, with significant interannual variability at all sites. Joint probability distributions of wind and wave conditions were generated from the data, and additionally the probability of having suitable window durations. It is shown that the risk of being unable to complete activities with varying vessel thresholds and access times is relatively high in all cases. Comparing the different sites, a higher significant wave height appears to be more prohibitive than a higher wind speed.},

This type of model has since seen use simulating behaviours of a range of animals ranging from clam larvae to moose in a range of environments. The flexibility of the model allows a range of environmental parameters to be included, allowing the response of the simulated animals to the environment to be investigated. The complexity of these models can vary considerably, and a number of additions can be made to the basic IBM structure. The detail and complexity of these models is in part constrained by the availability of environmental data and in part by available data of the animals to be simulated, which can be particularly difficult to obtain in a marine environment. A planned model for the behaviour of Harbour Porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) is given as an example use of these techniques.},

lakes advantage of the observation that vortices tend to be made up of

Due to the infancy of the industry and the challenges of exploiting the resource, the economic costs of realising industrial scale tidal current energy projects are significant and should be considered as one of the key drivers of array design. This paper proposes a framework for the automated design of tidal current turbine arrays in which costs over the lifespan of the array may be modelled and considered as part of the design optimisation process. To demonstrate this approach, the cost of sub-sea cabling is incorporated by implementing a cable-routing algorithm alongside an existing gradient-based array optimisation algorithm. Three idealised test scenarios are used to demonstrate the effects of a financial-return optimising design approach as contrasted with a power maximisation approach.},

Lett. vol. 95, 2005, 074501.1). The real-space analogue of this law is a logarithmic dependence on r of the streamwise longitudinal structure function. We show that, unlike the k(-1) law, the logarithmic law is readily seen in the experimental data. We argue that this difference arises from the finite value of Reynolds number in the experiments. Reducing the Reynolds number is equivalent to restricting the range of eddy sizes which contribute to the k(-1), or lnr, laws. While the logarithmic law is relatively insensitive to a truncation in the range of eddy sizes (it continues to hold over the relevant range of eddy sizes), it turns out that the k(-1) law is not. This is a direct consequence of the so-called aliasing problem associated with one-dimensional spectra, whereby energy is systematically and artificially displaced to small wavenumbers.},

abstract = {The present work is concerned with the development of a robust reconstruction algorithm for applications involving tomography. In an earlier study it was shown that among the ART family family of algorithms, the multiplicative algebraic reconstruction algorithm (MART) was the most appropriate for tomographic reconstruction [1]. In the present work, the MART algorithm has been extended so that (a) its performance is now acceptable over a wider range of relaxation factors, (b) the time requirement for convergence to a solution is lower, and (c) its performance is less sensitive to noise in the projection data. Applications considered for evaluating the proposed algorithms are (1) a circular region with holes, (2) a three-dimensional temperature field in a differentially heated fluid layer, and (3) experimental data recorded in a differentially heated fluid layer using an interferometer. The proposed algorithms are seen to be an improvement over those presently available, for all three examples considered. },

abstract = {Tidal stream turbines will be deployed in arrays to operate economically that will need to be optimally arranged for maximum energy extraction. Large Eddy Simulations are used to explore the channel scale optimisation and tuning of large array layout. Adaptive mesh and idealisations reduced the simulation time, allowing simulation of hundreds of tuned layouts with reasonable computational cost. The flow is driven by an elevation gradient, so the velocity reduces as turbines are added, allowing comparison of large arrays that remove a significant fraction of the natural velocity. If the array is restricted to only partially block the channel's width then the optimum layout depends on the number of partial rows in the array. Turbines should be packed densely on one side of the channel for one row and less densely packed for more rows. More total power is captured as rows are added to the array although the power that each turbine captures reduces as rows are added. The adaptive approach bridges the gap between large and small scale models of arrays and may be the first paper to numerically model array layout with partial rows or tuning at a channel scale.},

A two-equation lagged dissipation integral method is used to represent the viscous layers.

The Euler equations are discretized on a conservative streamline grid and are strongly coupled to a two-equation integral boundary-layer formulation, using the displacement thickness concept. A transition prediction formulation of the e9 type is derived and incorporated into the viscous formulation. The entire discrete equation set, including the viscous and transition formulations, is solved as a fully coupled nonlinear system by a global Newton method. This is a rapid and reliable method for dealing with strong viscous-inviscid interactions, which invariably occur in transonic and low Reynolds number airfoil flows. The results presented demonstrate the ability of the ISES code to predict transitioning separation bubbles and their associated losses. The rapid airfoil performance degradation with decreasing Reynolds number is thus accurately predicted. Also presented is a transonic airfoil calculation involving shock-induced separation, showing the robustness of the global Newton solution procedure. Good agreement with experiment is obtained, further demonstrating the performance of the present integral boundary-layer formulation.},

abstract = {Design and analysis methods for wind turbines are presently based on relatively simple models of rotor blade aerodynamics, such as 2-D blade element/momentum theory (BEMT). Field investigations over the past few years have shown discrepancies between predicted and measured performance, owing to the effect of rotation on the wind turbine blade boundary layer distribution. The present paper is aimed at describing a fundamental phenomenon: the effect of rotation on the blade boundary layer of a wind turbine. In this paper, 3-D incompressible steady momentum integral boundary layer equations are employed to study this complex problem. By solving the 3-D integral boundary layer equations with the assumed velocity profiles and a closure model (including both laminar and turbulent boundary layer models), the effects of rotation on blade boundary layers are investigated. Several key parameters, such as separation position and momentum thickness, are calculated and compared for the rotation and non-rotation cases. It is concluded that the stall is postponed due to rotation and the separation point is delayed as a result of increasing rotation speed or decreasing blade spanwise position. Possible modifications that should be considered to the existing 2-D BEMT method are suggested.},

abstract = {Tidal stream turbines are frequently incorporated within ocean and basin scale numerical models in an attempt to quantify the available resource and characterise the environmental response to energy extraction. The fundamental principle behind tidal stream energy extraction via horizontalaxis turbines is straightforward - the kinetic energy of the moving fluid is transferred to the turbine rotor. Describing the complexities of this process is more challenging - energy extraction is non-linear in current speed. Furthermore, inefficiencies in turbine operation, drag on the turbine support structure and mixing in the turbine wake all dissipate energy that is not reflected in electricity generation. For arrays of multiple turbines these additional energy sinks are not negligible. Consequently, there exists a potential dissonance between site developers and regulators as there is a fundamental difference between licensing the level of electricity generation and the total level of energy extraction. In this paper, we simulate an array of tidal stream turbines in the Pentland Firth, Scotland. A two-dimensional hydrodynamic model provides a useful and reliable description of this environment. A parameterisation of tidal stream turbines accounts for the non-linear response of turbine output to current speed and the influence of turbine support structure. We show that energy dissipation by an array can significantly exceed power production. Accounting for turbine non-linearity at high current speeds, however, limits the magnitude of the peak environmental stress. Implications for array modelling are discussed from the perspective of performing environmental impact assessment.},

abstract = {The present thesis summarizes work on developing a method for unsteady aerodynamic analysis primarily for aeroelastic simulations. In contrast to widely used prediction tools based on frequency-domain representations, the current approach aims to provide a time-domain simulation capability which can be readily integrated with possibly nonlinear structural and control system models. Further, due to the potential flow model underlying the computational method, and the solution algorithm based on an efficient boundary element formulation, the computational effort for the solution is moderate, allowing time-dependent simulations of complex configurations. The computational method is applied to simulate a number of wind-tunnel experiments involving highly flexible models. Two of the experiments are utilized to verify the method and to ascertain the validity of the unsteady flow model. In the third study, simulations are used for the numerical optimization of a configuration with multiple control surfaces. Here, the flexibility of the model is exploited in order to achieve a reduction of induced drag. Comparison with experimental results shows that the numerical method attains adequate accuracy within the inherent limits of the potential flow model. Finally, rather extensive aeroelastic simulations are performed for the ASK 21 sailplane. Time-domain simulations of a pull-up maneuver and comparisons with flight test data demonstrate that, considering modeling and computational effort, excellent agreement is obtained. Furthermore, a flutter analysis is performed for the same aircraft using identified frequency-domain loads. Results are found to deviate only slightly from critical speed and frequency obtained using an industry-standard aeroelastic analysis code. Nevertheless, erratic results for control surface hinge moments indicate that the accuracy of the present method would benefit from improved control surface modeling and coupled boundary layer analysis.},

abstract = {Tomographic particle image velocimetry was used to quantitatively visualize the three-dimensional coherent structures in a supersonic (Mach 2) turbulent boundary layer in the region between y/$\delta$=0.15 and 0.89. The Reynolds number based on momentum thickness Re$\theta$ =34 000. The instantaneous velocity fields give evidence of hairpin vortices aligned in the streamwise direction forming very long zones of low- speed fluid, consistent with Tomkins {\&} Adrian (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 490, 2003, p. 37). The observed hairpin structure is also a statistically relevant structure as is shown by the conditional average flow field associated to spanwise swirling motion. Spatial low-pass filtering of the velocity field reveals streamwise vortices and signatures of large-scale hairpins (height{\textgreater}0.5$\delta$), which are weaker than the smaller scale hairpins in the unfiltered velocity field. The large-scale hairpin structures in the instantaneous velocity fields are observed to be aligned in the streamwise direction and spanwise organized along diagonal lines. Additionally the autocorrelation function of the wall- normal swirling motion representing the large-scale hairpin structure returns positive correlation peaks in the streamwise direction (at 1.5$\delta$ distance from the DC peak) and along the 45 diagonals, which also suggest a periodic arrangement in those directions. This is evidence for the existence of a spanwisestreamwise organization of the coherent structures in a fully turbulent boundary layer},

abstract = {This paper describes the principles of a novel 3D PIV system based on the illumination, recording and reconstruction of tracer particles within a 3D measurement volume. The technique makes use of several simultaneous views of the illuminated particles and their 3D reconstruction as a light intensity distribution by means of optical tomography. The technique is therefore referred to as tomographic particle image velocimetry (tomographic-PIV). The reconstruction is performed with the MART algorithm, yielding a 3D array of light intensity discretized over voxels. The reconstructed tomogram pair is then analyzed by means of 3D cross-correlation with an iterative multigrid volume deformation technique, returning the three-component velocity vector distribution over the measurement volume. The principles and details of the tomographic algorithm are discussed and a parametric study is carried out by means of a computer-simulated tomographic-PIV procedure. The study focuses on the accuracy of the light intensity field reconstruction process. The simulation also identifies the most important parameters governing the experimental method and the tomographic algorithm parameters, showing their effect on the reconstruction accuracy. A computer simulated experiment of a 3D particle motion field describing a vortex ring demonstrates the capability and potential of the proposed system with four cameras. The capability of the technique in real experimental conditions is assessed with the measurement of the turbulent flow in the near wake of a circular cylinder at Reynolds 2,700. },

abstract = {The paper discusses bias errors introduced in Tomographic-PIV velocity measurements by the coherent motion of ghost particles under some circumstances. It occurs when a ghost particle is formed from the same set of actual particles in both reconstructed volumes used in the cross-correlation analysis. The displacement of the resulting ghost particle pair is approximately the average displacement of the set of associated actual particles. The effect is further quantified in a theoretical analysis and in numerical simu- lations and illustrated in an actual experiment. It is shown that the bias error does not significantly affect the measured flow topology as deduced in an evaluation of the local velocity gradients. Instead, it leads to a systematic underes- timation of the measured particle displacement gradient magnitude. This phenomenon is alleviated when the differ- ence between particles displacement along the volume depth is increased beyond a particle image diameter, or when the reconstruction quality is increased or when the accuracy of the tomographic reconstruction is improved. Furthermore, guidelines to detect and avoid such bias errors are proposed.},

abstract = {Tidal turbine blades are smaller than wind turbine blades yet carry similar bending moments. This provides a structural challenge and limits how thin the blades can be made, which subsequently affects the hydrodynamic performance of the rotor. Thinner blades generally offer higher performance but require thicker laminates hence are more expensive to build. Opinions vary amongst tidal turbine developers as to the best compromise for overall cost of energy. The parametric study presented in this paper includes a full structural and hydrodynamic design of a megawatt-scale axial flow tidal turbine rotor. Typical tidal turbine site parameters are assumed in terms of flow speed, turbulence and wave loading based on Gurit's experience of several rotors of this size. The blades are designed using epoxy composites in accordance with industry best practice. The blade thickness, chord and twist distribution are varied to find the effect on annual energy production and blade manufacturing cost in series production. Account is taken of the step changes in manufacturing method necessary as the blades are made thinner. Conclusions are drawn on the optimum blade thickness distribution for the assumed flow conditions and the effects of deviating from it.},

abstract = {The OWC spar-buoy is an axisymmetric device consisting basically of a (relatively long) submerged vertical tail tube open at both ends and fixed to a floater that moves essentially in heave. The air flow displaced by the motion of the OWC inner free-surface, relative to the buoy, drives an air turbine. Here, numerical procedures and results are presented for the power output from turbines of different sizes equipping a given OWC spar-buoy in a given offshore wave climate, the rotational speed (maximum allowable blade tip speed of 180 m/s) being optimized for each of the sea states that, together with their frequency of occurrence, characterize the wave climate. Single- and multi-stage Wells turbines and the new biradial impulse turbine were chosen for comparisons. Non-dimensional performance curves of the turbines were obtained from model testing. A stochastic approach was adopted for the hydrodynamic modelling, with air compressibility effects accounted for in a linearized way. The results for the overall performance show that a single-stage Wells turbine would not be a good choice, several stages being required for acceptable performance. The biradial turbine appears as the best choice in terms of performance, with the advantage of substantially smaller rotor diameter. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Attention is given to the need for a space-scale decomposition of turbulent flows and to the principles of wavelet transform. An analyzing function must have an average that is zero to be called a wavelet, and wavelets must be mutually similar, invertible, and regular. Continuous wavelet transform is described in terms of its analysis and synthesis, and the main properties of this process include linearity, covariance by translation and dilation, energy conservation, and space-scale locality. Comparison is made to the process of discrete wavelet transform which uses quasiorthogonal wavelet frames and interpolation.

abstract = {In the spirit of Ha Minh's semi-deterministic model, we propose a new
method for computing fully-developed turbulent flows, called Coherent
Vortex Simulation (CVS). It is based on the observation that turbulent
flows contain both an organized part, the coherent vortices, and a
random part, the incoherent background flow. The separation into
coherent and incoherent contributions is done using the wavelet
coefficients of the vorticity field and the Biot-Savart kernel to
reconstruct the coherent and incoherent velocity fields. The evolution
of the coherent part is computed using a wavelet basis, adapted at each
time step to resolve the regions of strong gradients, while the
incoherent part is discarded during the flow evolution, which models
turbulent dissipation. The CVS method is similar to LES, but it uses
nonlinear multiscale band-pass filters, which depend on the
instantaneous flow realization, while LES uses linear low-pass filters,
which do not adapt to the flow evolution. As example, we apply the CVS
method to compute a time developing two-dimensional mixing layer and a
wavelet forced two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic flow. We also
demonstrate how walls or obstacles can be taken into account using
penalization and compute a two-dimensional flow past an array of
cylinders. Finally, we perform the same segmentation into coherent and
incoherent components in a three-dimensional homogeneous isotropic
turbulent flow. We show that the coherent components correspond to
vortex tubes, which exhibit non-Gaussian statistics and long-range
correlation, with the same k(-5/3) power-law energy spectrum as the
total flow. In contrast, the incoherent components correspond to an
homogeneous random background flow which does not contain organized
structures and presents an energy equipartition together with a Gaussian
PDF of velocity. This justifies their elimination during the CVS
computation to model turbulent dissipation.},

abstract = {We decompose turbulent flows into two orthogonal parts: a coherent, inhomogeneous, non-Gaussian component and an incoherent, homogeneous, Gaussian component. The two components have different probability distributions and different correlations, hence different scaling laws. This separation into coherent vortices and incoherent background flow is done for each flow realization before averaging the results and calculating the next time step. To perform this decomposition we have developed a nonlinear scheme based on an objective threshold defined in terms of the wavelet coefficients of the vorticity. Results illustrate the efficiency of this coherent vortex extraction algorithm. As an example we show that in a 2562 computation 0.7{\%} of the modes correspond to the coherent vortices responsible for 99.2{\%} of the energy and 94{\%} of the enstrophy. We also present a detailed analysis of the nonlinear term, split into coherent and incoherent components, and compare it with the classical separation, e.g., used for large eddy simulation, into large scale and small scale components. We then propose a new method, called coherent vortex simulation CVS, designed to compute and model two-dimensional turbulent flows using the previous wavelet decomposition at each time step. This method combines both deterministic and statistical approaches: i Since the coherent vortices are out of statistical equilibrium, they are computed deterministically in a wavelet basis which is remapped at each time step in order to follow their nonlinear motions. ii Since the incoherent background flow is homogeneous and in statistical equilibrium, the classical theory of homogeneous turbulence is valid there and we model statistically the effect of the incoherent background on the coherent vortices. To illustrate the CVS method we apply it to compute a two-dimensional turbulent mixing layer.},

@article{Faudot2013,
abstract = {As tidal turbine prototypes are likely to be installed at many locations around the world, it is important to identify the different load cases and especially the extreme loads on the blades such as those occurring in a runaway situation. In normal conditions, the rotor converts the kinetic energy of the water stream into mechanical energy, which is in turn converted into electrical energy by the generator. Runaway occurs when this last step is suddenly missing, following the loss of the connection to the output grid. The hydrodynamic torque on the rotor is then unbalanced and the rotor accelerates. The measurements carried out in a towing tank agrees with the CFD simulation and the quasi-static blade element momentum theory (BEM) on the large angular acceleration when the turbine is released, on the settled angular velocity (runaway speed) and on the steady thrust force equal to almost twice the operating thrust. But the quasi-static BEM is not able to capture dynamic effects, and thus predict the high peaks in angular velocity and thrust force. The structural integrity of the blades is then threatened by both the high stresses related to the large rotor acceleration and the jump in thrust force, arising from the increase in tip speed ratio and significant dynamic effects. This runaway load case is expected to be higher for tidal turbines than wind turbines due to the lower moment of inertia of the rotor and the high density of water. The object of this paper is to estimate the forces acting on the blades in runaway situation using an experimental and a numerical approach (CFD computation with ANSYS-CFX).},

abstract = {For an optimum performance of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC) it is very important to adjust the operating conditions of the device with respect to the incident wave characteristics. This means that different wave conditions require different device settings, i.e. geometries, structure dynamics, Power Take Off (PTO), or mooring lines if active mooring lines are deployed. The coupling between the control system of the device and an accurate real time wave prediction tool plays a very important role in the power output of a WEC, especially in the case of floating WECs where the setting of the proper body dynamics is crucial for different wave conditions, i.e. to avoid or enforce resonance, minimize or maximize heave or pitch, etc. In this work artificial intelligence is employed to perform real time wave predictions. The results indicate that if wave conditions in an area close to a wave farm are available (a forecasting horizon of about 10 s is considered), dynamic neural networks can predict the wave conditions in the wave farm deployment area, allowing to set the optimum configuration for each WEC.},

abstract = {In this paper, an optical non-contact low budget method for tracking the position of multi-object is presented for marine/off-shore laboratory applications. Particular focus is given at the wave energy field and the analysis of floating wave energy converters dynamics. The measurement of the position and orientation is often a key point in this context, achieved nowadays with different standard technologies. Typically a base requirement for a measurement system is to be accurate and precise, without affecting the dynamical and statical behaviour of the system itself. Video based systems satisfy these points, but they are typically prohibitively expensive. Through the article a low budget one-camera video based system is presented and compared with other two standard methods: direct physical measurement and inertial motion unit (IMU). The system was tested both, in a dry environment and in waves. Results show an average error below 4{\%}, with increased high signal accuracy and precision in the low frequency components but also increased high frequency noise components. Further investigation will be addressed to the implementation of a hybrid system, where the corrupted high frequency information can be replaced by the IMU signal.},

abstract = {PLAT-O (Platform for Ocean Energy) is a taut moored, buoyant, subsea reaction sub-system, which acts as a support structure for Tidal Energy Converters (TECs). A comprehensive series of tests was undertaken in the water circulation channel at IFREMER on a three-buoyancy-module/dual-turbine model. The dynamic response of the device was measured in a wide range of flow velocities, wave conditions (with/against current) and turbulence levels. The main outcome of this experimental campaign has been the clear influence of the mooring geometry on the motion response, and more precisely a greater understanding of the levels of pre-tension required in the mooring lines to minimise motion to acceptable levels. By carefully distributing the hydrostatic loads due to the net buoyancy of the device and the dynamic loads created by the drag of the device and the thrust generated by the turbines, it is possible to substantially reduce the motion response of the device under a wide range of combined current and wave scenarios with obvious benefits. The load cycles on the mooring lines and particularly shock loads or “snatching” can be significantly decreased, reducing the risk of failure and increasing the lifetime of the mooring components. The turbines operate on a stable platform without suffering the effects of motion-induced flow particle velocity variations on the blades.},

abstract = {The effect of flow shear on turbine performance and wake development is examined. A computational model of an axial flow tidal turbine is developed and validated, and performance evaluated in sheared velocity profiles representative of a tidal channel. The computational model is developed in the commercial flow solver ANSYS Fluent. The rotor is resolved with a body-fitted grid, which is allowed to rotate relative to the channel boundaries. Lateral boundary conditions are applied so as to simulate an infinite row of turbines. The free surface of the flow is modelled as a rigid lid, by applying a slip condition at the upper surface of the domain. A sheared velocity profile is defined at an upstream boundary and maintained throughout the channel through the specification of shear stress at the channel bed. Comparison of the model against scale turbine experiments is reported. The device is simulated at various vertical positions in a sheared flow. Rotor thrust and power are observed to increase with elevation above the channel bed. This is a consequence of the higher kinetic flux available in upper portions of the velocity profile. Further, it is found that using an alternative normalisation for thrust and power, based on the area average of the square and cube of the upstream velocity profile, enables collapse of results across a range of sheared profiles.},

abstract = {Cinematographic stereoscopic PIV measurements were performed in the far field of an axisymmetric co-flowing turbulent round jet (Re  T ≈ 150, where Re  T is the Reynolds number based on Taylor micro scale) to resolve small and intermediate scales of turbulence. The time-resolved three-component PIV measurements were performed in a plane normal to the axis of the jet and the data were converted to quasi-instantaneous three-dimensional (volumetric) data by using Taylor's hypothesis. The availability of the quasi-three-dimensional data enabled the computation of all nine components of the velocity gradient tensor over a volume. The use of Taylor's hypothesis was validated by performing a separate set of time-resolved two component “side-view” PIV measurements in a plane along the jet axis. Probability density distributions of the velocity gradients computed using Taylor's hypothesis show good agreement with those computed directly with the spatially resolved data. The overall spatial structure of the gradients computed directly exhibits excellent similarity with that computed using Taylor's hypothesis. The accuracy of the velocity gradients computed from the pseudo-volume was assessed by computing the divergence error in the flow field. The root mean square (rms) of the divergence error relative to the magnitude of the velocity gradient tensor was found to be 0.25, which is consistent with results based on other gradient measurement techniques. The velocity gradients, vorticity components and mean dissipation in the self-similar far field of the jet were found to satisfy the axisymmetric isotropy conditions. The divergence error present in the data is attributed to the intrinsic uncertainty associated with performing stereoscopic PIV measurements and not to the use of Taylor's hypothesis. The divergence error in the data is found to affect areas of low gradient values and manifests as nonphysical values for quantities like the normalized eigenvalues of the strain-rate tensor. However, the high gradients are less affected by the divergence error and so it can be inferred that structural features of regions of intense vorticity and dissipation will be faithfully rendered},

The new all-in-one method (DCT-PLS), based on a penalized least squares approach (PLS), combines the use of the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the generalized cross-validation, thus allowing fast unsupervised smoothing of PIV data. The DCT-PLS was compared with conventional methods, including the normalized median test, for post-processing of simulated and experimental raw PIV velocity fields. The DCT-PLS was shown to be more efficient than the usual methods, especially in the presence of clustered outliers. It was also demonstrated that the DCT-PLS can easily deal with a large amount of missing data. Because the proposed algorithm works in any dimension, the DCT-PLS is also suitable for post-processing of volumetric three-component PIV data.},

abstract = {The status of marine current tidal energy technology is currently in the research and development phase, with a few deployments and tests of prototypes under-way in some countries. There is huge pressure for tidal farms to be of GW scale in order to have a real, economically viable impact on renewable energy utilization targets outlined for 2020. A route to achieving this is the large scale energy farm philosophy, similar to wind farms, based on very large numbers of unit current tidal stream devices. However, this in-mature technology development raises different research questions which lead to further problems in the practical implementation of tidal stream devices. Thus, the aim of the work described in this paper was (i) to formulate simplified parameterised analytic models of individual and clusters of tidal stream devices using the concept of linear momentum actuator disc theory, (ii) to perform a detailed calculations of the flow field of multiple turbines using the developed models, and (iii) to compare the analytic model results with the results calculated using a CFD based Immersed Body Force (IBF) model. This study has been mainly focused on a new device, Momentum-Reversal- Lift (MRL), which is a cross flow type of tidal turbine developed by Aquascientific Ltd. Several analytic models have been developed to describe the flow characteristics downstream of the turbine, i.e. the wake velocity profile and to estimate the total power extraction from a tidal stream farm containing ideally tenth and hundreds of devices. The developed models showed the capability to examine the wake characteristics and to estimate the performance of clusters of turbines taking in to consideration the influence of turbine to turbine interactions. A small longitudinal spacing between turbines inflicted a massive energy shadowing that affects the performance of downstream turbines. Based on the analysis of the influence of wake interaction, more than 91{\%} of the performance of an isolated turbine can be achieved with turbines spaced 20D apart. In addition, comparison of the wake velocity profiles and the power extraction calculated using both the analytic and CFD models showed reasonable agreement.},

abstract = {In this feasibility study the tomographic PIV technique has been applied to time resolved PIV recordings for the study of the growth of a turbulent spot in a laminar flat plate boundary layer and to visualize the topology of coherent flow structures within a tripped turbulent flat plate boundary layer flow. The experiments are performed around (Re (x) )(1/2) approximate to 450 in a low speed wind-tunnel using four high speed CMOS cameras operating up to 5 kHz. The volume illumination required a multiple-reflection system able to intensify light intensity within the measurement volume. This aspect is deemed essential when a high-speed tomographic PIV system is applied in air flows. The particle image recordings are used for a three dimensional tomographic reconstruction of the light intensity distribution within the illuminated volume. Each pair of reconstructed three-dimensional light distributions is analyzed by 3D spatial cross-correlation using iterative multi-grid schemes with volume-deformation, yielding a correlated time sequence of three-dimensional instantaneous velocity vector volumes. The coherent structures organization is analyzed by 3D-vorticity and -swirling-strength iso-surfaces visualization. In both flow types streaks and hairpin-like or arch vortical structures are most prominent. The data gives insight into the role of these structures for the spatio-temporal arrangement of the wall normal flow exchange mechanisms, especially of the instantaneous Reynolds stress events Q2 and Q4. A description of different self-sustainable flow organizations based on modifications of the hairpin-vortex- and streak-models is given. Two preliminary results are essential: Self-sustainability of a coherent vortical structure depends on the ability to entrain high momentum fluid, initially Q4. And, stream-wise swirl at the near-wall region of arch or hairpin-like vortices has been observed to be rare.},

abstract = {Our team has proposed recently the incorporation of the encased version of the Oscillating Water Column plant, where the compressed air is driven back to the main chamber after passing through a sequence of two additional chambers. In between these chambers a turbine rotor is positioned, so that net power is generated through the corresponding reduction in the air stream pressure. The concept has the advantage of maintaining a fixed flow direction, thus avoiding the reciprocating action that characterizes the Wells Turbine plants. In addition, the air flow recirculates within a plant embedded within the shoreline, not communicating with the surrounding atmosphere with the accompanying noise implications. The analysis, so far, has shown that this requires a rather strict control on the power – pressure drop relationship for the turbine rotor. In order to widen the operational limits of the scheme, the present study evaluates the merits of a modified concept where an additional pressure relief valve (parallel to the rotor) blocks the tendencies for overpressure within the first of the upper chambers. The analysis evaluates the efficiency drop of the plant with the action of the valve and the widening of the operational limits. The theoretical model is based on the mass conservation equation for each of the three chambers and the perfect gas limit for the enclosed humid air.},

abstract = {A vast programme to exploit waves and tidal energy in Scottish waters is underway. The characterisation of nearshore waves in Scottish waters is complicated by the jagged coastline and archipelagos, and strong wave-current interactions in locations such as the Pentland Firth. In order to investigate the energy availability, the Environmental Research Institute has implemented the spectral wave model SWAN on an unstructured grid covering a large domain, including all potential energy sites, allowing long fetch distance ({\textgreater}600 km) and down to a fine resolution nearshore (50 m). Wave data were collected at two locations in the Pentland Firth from wave rider buoys during the first six months of 2012, completing Wavenet data near the Outer Hebrides and in Moray Firth. Although under-predicting some of the peak values, the model predictions generally reproduced the observed time series effectively at the four locations, with Pearson correlation coefficient r between 0.73 and 0.84 between predicted and measured time series for all sites. The seasonal and yearly wave power estimates were broadly consistent with previous assessments. The dominant wave energy is located on the western coasts with wave power reaching 200 kW/m during winter. An improved representation of ocean swell should improve future versions.},

abstract = {AbstractNumerous acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) surveys were performed in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a channel between the Orkney Islands and the northern coast of Scotland connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the North Sea to the east. The Pentland Firth has the highest tidal streams of the British Isles, and one of the highest that can be found around the globe. Here, the tidal energy industry is in its demonstration phase, but not many real current measurements are in the public domain. The authors present real current data, measured during different phases of the tidal cycle, using a vessel-mounted ADCP. The tidal changes can be rapid, and because the underway measurements take time, the apparent spatial patterns are affected by temporal variation. A method is described that estimated and corrected this temporal distortion using a hydrodynamic model. It appeared that ebb and flood streams did not fully overlap, and that the tidal streams were more complicated, turbulent, and variable than existing models suggest. The data were analyzed for characteristics pertinent to practical tidal stream energy exploitation, and two favorable sites in the Inner Sound are identified. All original current data are available from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC).},

abstract = {The critical ionization velocity (CIV) phenomenon involves the transfer of energy from neutrals moving relative to a plasma to electrons. Three mechanisms are discussed and illustrated with numerical simulations. If the elastic electron neutral collision frequency is large (comparable to the electron cyclotron frequency) the electrons can gain enough energy from the neutrals to ionize them. Newly created ions form beams in the plasma which are unstable to lower hybrid waves propagating obliquely to the magnetic field. These waves have an electric field component parallel to the background magnetic field which can accelerate electrons. However, the efficiency of this heating is significantly reduced by electromagnetic effects which occur when the relative velocity exceeds the Alfven speed or when the plasma beta is large. A third mechanism involves the E x B drift of electrons in the secondary electric field due to charge separation at the front of a neutral gas cloud. This E field is opposite to the neutral gas velocity and can be much larger than the polarization field. The electron drift excites the modified two-stream instability which causes rapid electron heating and thus ionization in the front.},

The work suggests that singularities may arise in the solution of non-linear parabolic equations due to their non-linearity.

abstract = {Abstract The terms of the steady-state, homogeneous turbulent kinetic energy budgets are obtained from measurements of turbulence and fine structure from the small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Remote Environmental Measuring Units (REMUS). The transverse component of Reynolds stress and the vertical flux of heat are obtained from the correlation of vertical and transverse horizontal velocity, and the correlation of vertical velocity and temperature fluctuations, respectively. The data were obtained using a turbulence package, with two shear probes, a fast-response thermistor, and three accelerometers. To obtain the vector horizontal Reynolds stress, a generalized eddy viscosity formulation is invoked. This allows the downstream component of the Reynolds stress to be related to the transverse component by the direction of the finescale vector vertical shear. The Reynolds stress and the vector vertical shear then allow an estimate of the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). Heat flux is obtained by correlating the vertical velocity with temperature fluctuations obtained from the FP-07 thermistor. The buoyancy flux term is estimated from the vertical flux of heat with the assumption of a constant temperature?salinity (T?S) relationship. Turbulent dissipation is obtained directly from the usage of shear probes. A multivariate correction procedure is developed to remove vehicle motion and vibration contamination from the estimates of the TKE terms. A technique is also developed to estimate the statistical uncertainty of using this estimation technique for the TKE budget terms. Within the statistical uncertainty of the estimates herein, the TKE budget on average closes for measurements taken in the weakly stratified waters at the entrance to Long Island Sound. In the strongly stratified waters of Narragansett Bay, the TKE budget closes when the buoyancy Reynolds number exceeds 20, an indicator and threshold for the initiation of turbulence in stratified conditions. A discussion is made regarding the role of the turbulent kinetic energy length scale relative to the length of the AUV in obtaining these estimates, and in the TKE budget closure.},

abstract = {Pacific Island Countries (PICs) have a huge renewable energy potential to meet their energy needs. Limited resources are available on land; however, large amount of ocean energy is available and can be exploited for power generation. PICs have more sea-area than land-area. Tidal current energy is very predictable and large amount of tidal current energy can be extracted using tidal current energy converters. A 10. m diameter, 3-bladed horizontal axis tidal current turbine (HATCT) is designed in this work. Hydrofoils were designed for different blade location; they are named as HF10XX. The hydrodynamic characteristics of the hydrofoils were analyzed. A thick hydrofoil with a maximum thickness of 24{\%} and a maximum camber of 10{\%} was designed for the root region. The maximum thickness of hydrofoils was varied linearly from the root to the tip for easier surface merging. For the tip region, a thinner hydrofoil of maximum thickness 16{\%} and maximum chamber 10{\%} was designed. It was ensured that the designed hydrofoils do not experience cavitation during the expected operating conditions. The characteristics of the HF10XX hydrofoils were compared with other commonly used hydrofoils. The blade chord and twist distributions were optimized using BEM theory. The theoretical power output and the efficiency of the rotor were also obtained. The maximum power at the rated current of 2. m/s is 150. kW and the maximum efficiency is 47.5{\%}. The designed rotor is found to have good efficiency at current speeds of 1-3. m/s. This rotor has better performance than some other rotors designed for HATCT. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Wave models are typically forced with synoptic wind fields at 3 hourly intervals. In reality, winds are highly turbulent and exhibit high spatial and temporal variability. Therefore, using 3 hourly wind fields to force wave models, the extent of the natural variability may be masked. Subsequently, the impact on generating surface waves may be underestimated. Until now research has been focused upon the effect of spatial resolution within hydrodynamic models with little research focusing on the effect of temporal resolution. Here, an idealised storm event, within a model domain of similar dimensions to the North Sea, is simulated using the SWAN wave model. The extent that fluctuating wind affects wave power has been examined, with a test case where wind, without additional gustiness, was input as the control. The results indicate that the inclusion of wind variability at sub hourly time-steps is likely to affect estimates of the wave power resource. Wave power is a function of the wave period and the square of wave height, both of which can be altered as a result of high frequency wind input. Consequently, understanding and accurately simulating the impact of wind variability on wave properties can improve the accuracy of wave power predictions.},

The first stages of a project investigating the use a passive-feather method to regulate the power output of a tidal turbine through PWM load control are presented. Theoretical and experimental investigations were undertaken to analyse the engineering system requirements and restraints associated with the use of this method. It is shown that, due to the increased terminal voltage loads as the rotor speeds up, the use of this method will require the increase in  to be limited. Furthermore, it is shown that a new blade design is likely to be required for this method. In designing this curve, a balance is required to be struck between producing a realistic curve that may be approximated in real life, and limiting the increase in . Consideration of the increase in voltage with  will play a large roll in the future of this research.},

orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to separate these two
contributions to the total energy. POD is combined with two new vortex
identification functions, Gamma (1) and Gamma (2). These functions
identify the locations of the centre and boundary of the vortex on the
basis of the velocity field. The POD computed for the measured velocity
fields shows that two spatial modes are responsible for most of the
fluctuations observed in the vicinity of the location of the mean
vortex centre. These two modes are also responsible for the large-scale
coherence of the fluctuations. The POD computed from the Gamma (2)
scalar field shows that the displacement and deformation of the
large-scale vortex are correlated to these modes. We suggest the use of
such a method to separate pseudo-fluctuations due to the unsteady

The results suggest the more complex approach of simulating absorption using directional and frequency absorption spectra in addition to the effects of wave reflections yields a more realistic simulation. This technique was further applied to a potential wave energy deployment site consisting of an array of 30 WEC devices identified by the Crown Estate in the Outer Hebrides in the United Kingdom. The boundary input used seasonal averaged data to represent winter, summer and a complete year's wave spectra. The results suggest there is an average shoreline reduction in wave power behind the array of 5{\%} with a peak value of 9.5{\%}. The inclusion of wave reflection in to the model leads to a larger average percentage change in wave power of 7.5{\%} 300m from the devices. While the results of this study also provide an insight into the distribution of wave energy around a nearshore array, this study focuses on developing advanced technique for the simulation of WECs.},

abstract = {Analysis of profiles of meteorological measurements from a 160 m high mast at the National Test Site for wind turbines at H{\o}vs{\o}re (Denmark) and at a 250 m high TV tower at Hamburg (Germany) shows that the wind profile based on surface-layer theory and Monin-Obukhov scaling is valid up to a height of 50 to 80 m. At higher levels deviations from the measurements progressively occur. For applied use an extension to the wind profile in the surface layer is formulated for the entire boundary layer, with emphasis on the lowest 200 - 300 m and considering only wind speeds above 3 m s-1 at 10 m height. The friction velocity is taken to decrease linearly through the boundary layer. The wind profile length scale is composed of three component length scales. In the surface layer the first length scale is taken to increase linearly with height with a stability correction following Monin-Obukhov similarity. Above the surface layer the second length scale( L becomes independent of height MBL ) but not of stability, and at the top of the boundary layer the third length scale is assumed to be negligible. A simple model for the combined length scale that controls the wind profile and its stability dependence is formulated by inverse summation. Based on these assumptions the wind profile for the entire boundary layer is derived. A parameterization of MBL L is formulated using the geostrophic drag law, which relates friction velocity and geostrophic wind. The empirical parameterization of the resistance law functions A and B in the geostrophic drag law is uncertain, making it impractical. Therefore an expression for the length scale, MBL L , for applied use is suggested, based on measurements from the two sites.},

First, alternative methods practised in the literature for both time-domain and frequency-domain comparison are assessed and compared. Next, certain novel extended methods are presented for the validation of 3D data, which is not often attempted in the literature. In particular, the shear profiles encountered in real high-velocity sites do not often follow the traditional logarithmic laws, so a new parameterisation is presented and tested. Finally, acoustic Doppler profiler (ADP) data are analysed and used in a case study validation exercise of a 3D hydrodynamic model of the Fall of Warness in the Orkney Islands, UK. Conclusions are drawn about the validity of the model, as well as the methodology applied. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We address the problem of resolving and localizing blurred point sources in intensity images. Telescopic star-field images blurred by atmospheric turbulence or optical aberrations are typical examples of this class of images, a new approach to image restoration is introduced, which is a generalization of 2-D sensor array processing techniques originating from the field of direction of arrival estimation (DOA). It is shown that in the frequency domain, blurred point source images can be modeled with a structure analogous to the response of linear sensor arrays to coherent signal sources. Thus, the problem may be cast into the form of DOA estimation, and eigenvector based subspace decomposition algorithms, such as MUSIC, may be adapted to search for these point sources. For deterministic point images the signal subspace is degenerate, with rank one, so rank enhancement techniques are required before MUSIC or related algorithms may be used. The presence of blur prohibits the use of existing rank enhancement methods. A generalized array smoothing method is introduced for rank enhancement in the presence of blur, and to regularize the ill posed nature of the image restoration. The new algorithm achieves inter-pixel super-resolution and is computationally efficient. Examples of star image deblurring using the algorithm are presented.},

Understandingthe limita- tions of BEM methods, used often by the wind turbine community, is very important for the better prediction of turbine power output and blade loads. The BEM theory has been revisited and is compared with vortex methods. The work shows the limits of applicability of the BEM methods and the better flexibility of the FVM to predict the aerodynamics of a wind turbine for a full range of wind turbine operatingstates includingthe vortex ringstate, for turbulent wake state and for yawed flow conditions. It is also shown that linear inflow models used in conjunction with the BEM theory may not be applicable for higher yaw angles. A universal power and thrust coefficient curve with the axial induction factor has also been derived to help understand the operatingflow states of a wind turbine over which the FVM can be applied.},

abstract = {Tomographic and time resolved PIV measurements were performed to examine the 3D flow topology and the flow dynamic above the upper surface of a low-aspect ratio cylinder at Re ≈ 1 × 105. This generic experiment is of fundamental interest because it represents flow features which are relevant to many applications such as laminar separation bubbles and turbulent reattachment. At Re ≈ 1 × 105, laminar separation bubbles arise on the side of the cylinder. Furthermore, on the top of the cylinder a separation with reattachment is of major interest. The tomographic PIV measurement, which allows to determine all three velocity components in a volume instantaneously, was applied to examine the flow topology and interaction between the boundary layer and wake structures on the top of the finite cylinder. In the instantaneous flow fields the tip vortices and the recirculation region becomes visible. However, it is also observed that the flow is quite unsteady due to the large separation occurring on the top of the cylinder. In order to study the temporal behaviour of the separation, time resolved PIV was applied. This technique allows capturing the dynamic processes in detail. The development of vortices in the separated shear layer is observed and in addition regions with different dominant frequencies are identified.},

abstract = {The development of an environmental hydrodynamic model is a key step in the site design and calculation of energy yield for marine renewable projects. For a tidal energy site the model provides the means to spatially and temporally predict the energy yield of devices located away from fixed measurement locations. In setting up a numerical model engineers have control over three significant inputs: bathymetry, boundary conditions and bed roughness. Determining the location of boundary conditions is a subjective matter that can either be tackled on a trial and error basis or as a conservative issue setting boundaries beyond a continental shelf. As the tidal energy industry progresses the uncertainty with which hydrodynamic models are able to predict conditions, and hence energy yield, is coming under increased scrutiny. In order to provide evidence as to the uncertainty associated with predicted values the quality of input data needs to be assessed. This paper presents the results of comparing a high resolution (0.125x0.125deg) global ocean model to predicted tidal heights, generated by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office, across the North West European Shelf. The mapped results are intended to provide a reference as to the quality and placement of boundary conditions for the qualitative assessment of energy yield predictions.},

The helical turbine had an efficiency of 33{\%} at a current velocity of 2.0–3.4 m/s. The efficiency of the entire power generating system was 26.7{\%} and nearly constant at current velocities from 2.2 m/s to 3.4 m/s.

abstract = {For ocean wave energy converters (WECs) to become a cost-effective alternative in the energy production system a large increase in the conversion efficiency is needed. Fluid power technology is the leading technology for the Power Take- Off (PTO) system of wave energy converters. However the conventional fluid power systems suffer of poor efficiency. Therefore discrete fluid power force systems have been proposed. Limited research has, however, been conducted with focus on choosing the discrete force levels and force profiles for a discrete PTO system for WECs. This paper is to support the design of discrete force systems for PTO, by focusing on how to choose the optimal PTO force levels and force profile when seeking to increase energy harvesting. The work concerns point absorber WECs and utilises a simple float model based on linear wave theory. Utilising the principle of superposition and the Laplace transform a solution of the float movement is found when subjected an incoming wave and a discrete PTO force. Finally an optimisation leads to the force profile implying the highest harvested energy.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to determine which wave conditions are inducing extreme mooring loads on a highly dynamically responding moored structure. Currently, the design of a mooring system for a typical oil and gas offshore structure is based on the prediction of the extreme mooring loads for a limited number of wave conditions along the envelope of a wave scatter diagram. During the design process, an inappropriate choice of wave conditions could lead to an incorrect estimation of extreme mooring loads, which may result either in the loss of the mooring system or in a costly overdesign. This paper draws on mooring tensions and wave conditions that have been recorded at a mooring test facility using a multi-leg catenary mooring system. The mooring loads have been assessed to identify extreme mooring loads, which have been analysed in respect to the corresponding wave conditions. Further, joint probability distributions of wave conditions that results in extreme mooring loads have been determined. The most important finding is that extreme mooring loads were not necessarily identified to occur on the envelope of the wave climate parameter scatter diagram.},

abstract = {At a commercial scale tidal stream turbines are likely to be installed in multi-device arrays to maximise power output from a tidal site. This paper demonstrates a computationally efficient method for predicting the performance of an array. The approach parameterises the turbine by deriving momentum source terms using blade element (BE) theory. The source terms are added to Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) momentum equations. The RANS+BE method is similar to blade element momentum (BEM) theory but can predict the flow field as well as the performance of the rotor. This investigation first verifies the RANS+BE method against BEM theory and shows good agreement, although tip-losses still need to be included. Secondly, it compares the RANS+BE approach to a parameterisation based on a uniform resistance coefficient, over a range of ambient turbulence values and thrust coefficients. The RANS+BE method generates increased azimuthal velocities in the near wake compared to the uniform approach. Finally the investigation compares results of a model of an infinitely wide array of turbines with five rows. The RANS+BE model can predict the performance of each turbine. and shows more rapid wake velocity recovery within the array. The investigation provides a detailed insight into the applicability of wake modelling techniques for the configuration of tidal stream turbine arrays.},

The results show that the CFD model gives reasonable agreement with the experimental results. The main factors affecting the wake structure are the initial CT value, the ambient turbulence levels, and potentially the disc induced turbulence. The main differences between the models and experiments were in terms of the turbulence levels throughout the model.

abstract = {The wave energy project at the Swedish Centre for Renewable Electric Energy Conversion at Uppsala University initiated its offshore experiments at the Lysekil Wave Energy Research Site in 2006. The wave energy converters in the project are composed of directly driven linear generators connected via a line to a point absorbing buoy. The WECs are interconnected in marine substation that pulls the generated electricity and transmits it to shore. The aim of this paper is to present a status update of the Lysekil project from the time of the previous EWTEC conference up until now. The presented materials include both theoretical and experimental research development, such as new designs and installations of generator, experimental results of rectification on power production as well as further developments within the experimental setup in Lysekil. The paper will also present research on device for avoiding tidal effects and environmental studies pursued at Uppsala University will also be described.},

abstract = {This study presents a simple image pre-processing scheme to extract
background information from double-frame particle image velocimetry
(PIV) images. Everything that stays stagnant in the image ( e. g.,
image background and light reflections from stationary objects) is
assumed to be a source of disturbance and is removed by subtracting the
second frame of the image pair from the first frame. This yields a
single frame difference image, which is transferred back to a
background extracted double-frame image. After the procedure the
background in the image does not correlate with itself anymore and
therefore a bias error in PIV analysis towards zero displacement is
avoided. The simulations show that the procedure conserves the pro. le
of tracer particle images when a displacement between the frames is
larger than a particle image size. The performance of this procedure is
emphasized with various examples, and extensions of the procedure are
introduced. The extended procedure extracts background objects that
move between the image frames, e. g. dispersed phase particles in a
two-phase flow or laser light sheet reflections from moving objects.},

abstract = {In this article, we present an experimental setup and data processing schemes for 3D scanning particle tracking velocimetry (SPTV), which expands on the classical 3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) through changes in the illumination, image acquisition and analysis. 3D PTV is a flexible flow measurement tech- nique based on the processing of stereoscopic images of flow tracer particles. The technique allows obtaining Lagrangian flow information directly from measured 3D trajectories of individual particles. While for a classical PTV the entire region of interest is simultaneously illu- minated and recorded, in SPTV the flow field is recorded by sequential tomographic high-speed imaging of the region of interest. The advantage of the presented method is a considerable increase in maximum feasible seeding density. Results are shown for an experiment in homogenous turbulence and compared with PTV. SPTV yielded an average 3,500 tracked particles per time step, which implies a significant enhancement of the spatial resolution for Lagrangian flow measurements.},

abstract = {Google Earth (GE) releases free images in high spatial resolution that may provide some potential for regional land use/cover mapping, especially for those regions with high heterogeneous landscapes. In order to test such practicability, the GE imagery was selected for a case study in Wuhan City to perform an object-based land use/cover classification. The classification accuracy was assessed by using 570 validation points generated by a random sampling scheme and compared with a parallel classification of QuickBird (QB) imagery based on an object-based classification method. The results showed that GE has an overall classification accuracy of 78.07{\%}, which is slightly lower than that of QB. No significant difference was found between these two classification results by the adoption of Z-test, which strongly proved the potentials of GE in land use/cover mapping. Moreover, GE has different discriminating capacity for specific land use/cover types. It possesses some advantages for mapping those types with good spatial characteristics in terms of geometric, shape and context. The object-based method is recommended for imagery classification when using GE imagery for mapping land use/cover. However, GE has some limitations for those types classified by using only spectral characteristics largely due to its poor spectral characteristics.},

@article{Huntley1988,
abstract = {Abstract The inertial dissipation method for estimating seabed friction velocities from near-bed turbulence spectra requires few measurements; it is relatively insensitive to errors in sensor orientation and measurement of mean flows. However, the method is only valid if turbulence spectra are measured at a height above the seabed that is small enough to be within the constant stress layer but large enough to produce an inertial subrange. It is shown that such a height exists only if the friction velocity exceeds a critical value (typically 0.8 cm s?1 for a midlatitude ocean). Recent measurements from combined wave and mean flow conditions on the continental shelf do not satisfy this requirement. However, an empirical modification to the inertial dissipation method is suggested to allow estimation of the friction velocity even when a true inertial subrange does not exist. The modified method is applied to the combined wave and mean flow field data; it virtually removes an increase in estimated friction velocity with height, and results in values which are in good agreement with theoretical expectation. It generally applicable, the modified method will significantly extend the range of conditions in which the inertial dissipation method can be used.},

abstract = {The impact of a wave farm depends on many factors. The objective of this work is to investigate whether different WECs, with different wave transmission coefficients, produce different impacts on the wave conditions in the lee of the wave farm and, if so, in which manner these impacts differ. For this purpose we consider eight case studies, corresponding to a wave farm in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) with four values of the wave transmission coefficient and subjected to two wave conditions, representative of typical summer and winter scenarios. Thus, the sensitivity analysis investigates whether, and if so, how, changes in the wave transmission coefficient affect the impact caused by the wave farm on the wave conditions in its lee in typical winter and summer scenarios. This impact is appraised through the significant wave height, wave energy dissipation due to bottom friction, and wave directional spreading. The sensitivity analysis is carried out by means of a state-of-the-art coastal wave model (SWAN) implemented on a high resolution grid, so that the wakes of the individual WECs of the farm are properly resolved. We find that the wave transmission coefficient of the WECs does play a significant role in the impact of the wave farm.},

It will also be explained why the velocity profile shape factor H is a suitable parameter to characterize stability diagrams for flows with and without suction. Finally a new database method will be presented that is based on the observation that many stability diagrams show a remarkable similarity when properly scaled and shifted.

Towards the future development of a floating attenuator type Wave Energy Conversion (WEC) device composed of multiple OWC chambers, a combined numerical-experimental working methodology is being followed, starting with experimental and numerical modelling of simplified devices and increasing the complexity up to the modelling of a floating multi-chamber device. Experimental and field testing involve high economic and time costs and for that reason the use of reliable numerical models is essential, especially during the early stages of WEC's development, both for geometry optimization and for first efficiency studies. In order to ensure realistic tools for OWC analysis, numerical models need to be calibrated and validated based on experimental data. Based on experimental results for a simple OWC chamber, the experimental calibration and validation is carried out in this work for some widely used numerical models in wave-structure interaction problems or floating bodies analysis. However, some of these models are very demanding computationally and for that reason, a simplified and faster time-domain model has also been built, experimentally calibrated and validated.},

Additionally, global medium-resolution land use land cover datasets may be insufficient for conservation planning purposes at the scale of a country or smaller. We thus introduce a new tool, GE Grids, to bridge this gap. This tool creates an interactive user-specified binary grid laid over Google Earth's high-resolution imagery. Using GE Grids, we manually identified anthropogenic land conversion across East Africa and compared this against available land cover datasets. Nearly 30{\%} of East Africa is converted to anthropogenic land cover. The two highest-resolution comparative datasets have the greatest agreement with our own at the regional extent, despite having as low as 44{\%} agreement at the country level. We achieved 83{\%} consistency among users. GE Grids is intended to complement existing remote sensing datasets at local scales.},

It is able to reproduce prescribed first and second order one point statistics, characteristic length and time scales, and the shape of coherent structures. The ability of the method to produce realistic inflow conditions in the test cases of a spatially decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence and of a fully developed turbulent channel flow is presented.

abstract = {Coherent structures (CS) near the wall (i.e. y(+) less than or equal to
60) in a numerically simulated turbulent channel flow are educed using a
conditional sampling scheme which extracts the entire extent of dominant
vortical structures. Such structures are detected from the instantaneous
flow field using our newly developed vortex definition (Jeong {\&} Hussain
1995) - a region of negative lambda(2), the second largest eigenvalue of
the tensor SikSkj + Omega(ik)Omega(kj) - which accurately captures the
structure details (unlike velocity-, vorticity- or pressure-based
eduction). Extensive testing has shown that lambda(2) correctly captures
vortical structures, even in the presence of the strong shear occurring
near the wall of a boundary layer. We have shown that the dominant
near-wall educed (i.e. ensemble averaged after proper alignment) CS are
highly elongated quasi-streamwise vortices; the CS are inclined 9
degrees in the vertical (x,y)-plane and tilted +/- 4 degrees in the
horizontal (x,z)-plane. The vortices of alternating sign overlap in x as
a staggered array; there is no indication near the wall of hairpin
vortices, not only in the educed data but also in instantaneous fields.
Our model of the CS array reproduces nearly all experimentally observed
events reported in the literature, such as VITA, Reynolds stress
distribution, wall pressure variation, elongated low-speed streaks,
spanwise shear, etc. In particular, a phase difference (in space)
between streamwise and normal velocity fluctuations created by CS
advection causes Q4 ('sweep') events to dominate Q2 ('ejection') and
also creates counter-gradient Reynolds stresses (such as Q1 and Q3
events) above and below the CS. We also show that these effects are
adequately modelled by half of a Batchelor's dipole embedded in (and
decoupled from) a background shear U(y). The CS tilling (in the
(x,z)-plane) is found to be responsible for sustaining CS through
redistribution of streamwise turbulent kinetic energy to normal and
spanwise components via coherent pressure-strain effects.},

abstract = {Considerable confusion surrounds the longstanding question of what constitutes a vortex, especially in a turbulent flow. This question, frequently misunderstood as academic, has recently acquired particular significance since coherent structures (CS) in turbulent flows are now commonly regarded as vortices. An objective definition of a vortex should permit the use of vortex dynamics concepts to educe CS, to explain formation and evolutionary dynamics of CS, to explore the role of CS in turbulence phenomena, and to develop viable turbulence models and control strategies for turbulence phenomena. We propose a definition of a vortex in an incompressible flow in terms of the eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor S2+a2; here S and 0 are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor Vu. This definition captures the pressure minimum in a plane perpendicular to the vortex axis at high Reynolds numbers, and also accurately defines vortex cores at low Reynolds numbers, unlike a pressure-minimum criterion. We compare our definition with prior schemes/definitions using exact and numerical solutions of the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for a variety of laminar and turbulent flows. In contrast to definitions based on the positive second invariant of Vu or the complex eigenvalues of Vu, our definition accurately identifies the vortex core in flows where the vortex geometry is intuitively clear.},

abstract = {Lowering the overall cost of wave energy converters is a necessity for creating a feasible solution to renewable energy. The design of wave energy converters is in general based on traditional steel design methods. In the design of steel structures subjected to significant dynamical loading and a harsh environment issues such fatigue resistance and durability are of major concern. The welded joints in steel structures significantly reduce the fatigue resistance and give a low utilization ratio of the steel material. Furthermore is coating of all exposed steel surfaces a necessity to secure a sufficient durability of the entire structure. Consequently it will be of great concern to optimize the structural concepts of the wave energy converters and secondly find materials tailored to the harsh environment at sea. The paper shows that utilizing Ultra High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete as primary material in the design of wave energy converters is a feasible and promising solution, which reduce the overall cost of the structure significantly. This will be illustrated by means of a feasibility study carried out on the Wavestar project, where special attention is pointed at the arm and float structure . The arm structure is previously designed as a steel structure, whereas the float has been designed as a light weight glass fibre structure. The new UHPFRC design gives a very beneficial solution that will contribute to the reduction of the manufacturing and the maintenance cost of the Wavestar wave energy converter.},

The tests were carried out in the high-speed water channel at the University of Liverpool. A three blade model of a HATT with a rotor diameter of 0.5m was used with an upstream water velocity of 0.5m/s. Regular linear waves were produced using a paddle wavemaker which produces a wide range of wave-current flows. An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter was used to measure three-dimensional velocity components through the water depth below the waves. The streamwise and vertical velocity components showed excellent agreement with linear wave theory. Thrust and power measurements were taken for uniform flow and two waveforms of different wavelength and frequency. It was observed that the presence of waves caused a significant cyclic variation in the power and thrust but the mean coefficients of power and thrust in the unsteady flow conditions were very similar to those obtained in steady flow.},

abstract = {The turbine is one of the most important components of a tidal current power device, and can convert current flow to rotational energy. Generally, a tidal turbine has two or three blades that are subjected to hydrodynamic loads. The blades are continuously deformed by various incoming flow velocities. Depending on the velocities, blade size, and material, the deformation rates would be different that could affect the performance of turbine and power rate as well. Surely deformed blades would decrease the performance of the turbine. However, most studies of turbine performance have been being introduced without considerations on the blade deformation. The power estimation and analysis should consider the deformed blade shape for accurate output power. This paper describes a fluid- structure interaction (FSI) analysis conducted using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the finite element method (FEM) to estimate turbine performance. The loss of turbine efficiency was calculated for a deformed blade that decreased by 2.2{\%} with maximum deformation of 216mm at the blade tip. The principal causes of power loss, which induced by blade deformation were analysed and summarised in this paper.},

The cable dynamics model has been developed as a stand-alone library that can be coupled to any body motion solver. In this study the open-source CFD package OpenFOAM has been employed. Preliminary test cases using incident regular Stoke's 5th order waves are presented, both for wave heights corresponding to operational conditions of the WEC as for a more severe condition in survival mode.

abstract = {A new method of predicting boundary layer transition is presented which models the near wall velocity fluctuations induced in the laminar layer through pressure fluctuations associated with the freestream turbulence. These near wall velocity fluctuations are then assumed to develop into turbulent spots when their amplitude exceeds a threshold value. A relationship for the near wall velocity frequency spectra is also established, which indicates an increasing bias towards low frequencies as the skin friction coefficient for the boundary layer decreases. This result suggests that the dependence of transition on the turbulent length scale is greatest at low freestream turbulence levels. This transition model is incorporated in a conventional boundary layer integral technique and is used to predict eight of the ERCOFTAC test cases and measurements of Gostelow and co-workers. The model is demonstrated to predict the development of the boundary layer through transition reasonably accurate for all the test cases. The sensitivity of start of transition to the turbulent length scale at low freestream turbulence levels is also demonstrated. The model is also able to predict the evolution of measured intermittency more accurately than the Narasimha empirical correlation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a study to select an appropriate location for the ShoreSWEC wave energy converter to be incorporated in a new breakwater and to design and test the chamber layout of the device. In order to identify a suitable port development on the South African coast appropriate site selection criteria were developed based on the construction and operational requirements of the device. Once an appropriate site was selected the spectral wave model, SWAN, was used to transfer 11 years of hindcast NCEP wave data from deep sea to the selected site. Results of the wave modeling procedure were validated through comparison with measured wave data near the site. The operational wave conditions were found to be an average wave height of 0.5 m with an 11 s wave period from predominately the northwest direction and the mean annual average wave power approximately 2.3 kW/m. The hundred year design storm conditions were found to be a significant wave height of 4.94 m and peak wave period of 17 s, also from the northwest. The stability of the device was evaluated under the wave loads caused by these design conditions. The formulae of Goda [1] were used to estimate the pressure distribution and corresponding forces and overturning moments acting on the vertical and inclined front wall of the device. It was found that an 18 m wide (5.6 m capture chamber and 12.4 m ballast chamber), 13.2 m long and 15.1 m high unit provided sufficient stability under design load conditions. Preliminary results from tank tests are presented to evaluate the conversion efficiency of the device at the selected location.},

One of the emerging technologies for extracting offshore renewable and sustainable energy is the horizontal axis tidal current turbine. They are, in term of configuration and technology, very similar to medium size horizontal axis wind turbines. Due to their similarity it is possible and reasonable to use experience in the wind industry to investigate the potential reliability issues that may occur in the tidal industry. One of the persistent reliability issues in the wind industry is the failure of wind turbine drivetrains. Design deficiencies caused by a lack of in-depth understanding of the operating conditions had been suggested as the possible cause of failures. It is therefore critical that the operating conditions of tidal current turbines are thoroughly understood. Understanding and quantifying the loads will play an important role in assessing the reliability of tidal turbine designs. This paper demonstrates the influence of tidal turbulence on non-torque loads in the main shaft of a tidal turbine. Loads in the main shaft are transmitted through the drivetrain hence some common failure modes which may occur in the drivetrain are discussed.},

The modeled system is energetically complete in the sense that the model does not have an open boundary and the integrated energy balance has no exchange term with the outside ocean. Both normal and tidally near-resonant fjords are considered. A series of energy extraction experiments is performed to establish the scaling between energy extraction and changes in the tidal parameters with in the estuary and the surrounding ocean. These experiments confirm previous theoretical results on the scaling. At maximum extraction, approximately half the energy extracted is redirected from natural dissipation within the fjord, while the remainder is drawn anew from the ocean. The experiments are then repeated with a pair of subdomain models of different domain extent, for which tides sampled from the complete model are used as boundary conditions.

Previous field experimentation has demonstrated that the greatest structural fatigue damage tends to occur during the nighttime hours from coherent turbulence that develops in the stable, nocturnal atmospheric boundary layer. We have found that under such conditions, intense vertical wind shear and temperature gradients create resonant flow fields that are capable of imparting short-period loading and vibrational energy as wind turbine rotor blades pass through regions of organized or coherent turbulence. This energy is subsequently propagated throughout the remainder of the structure, where it is often locally dissipated. We also briefly discuss our recent progress in developing a numerical simulation that includes such coherent inflow conditions that can be used to excite wind turbine design codes.},

abstract = {As part of an investigation into the feasibility of an offshore combined wind/wave energy converting platform, comprising one or more wind turbines mounted on a floating structure in which a number of oscillating water columns (OWCs) are embedded, testing was carried out on a 1:50 scale model of the wave energy converting component of the platform. The model comprises two legs joined at one end at an angle of 90 degrees. A form of soft latching is implemented through the use of high and low-pressure plenums to which the OWC chambers communicate via air admittance valves. The model was tested in a number of configurations, subject to varying amounts of simulated power take-off damping and over a range of incident regular-wave periods. Platform motions, OWC chamber and plenum pressure and water column motions were recorded for each test. This paper discusses some considerations in the design, construction, instrumentation and testing of the model. Thermodynamic theory describing the flow of air throughout the system, based on the conservation of mass, is developed and related to the motion of the water columns. Representative results from the model testing in the time domain are presented. Finally, some conclusions are drawn from these results.},

abstract = {Vorticity filaments are characteristic structures of two-dimensional turbulence. The formation, persistence and effect of vorticity filaments are examined using a high-resolution direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the merging of two positive Gaussian vortices pushed together by a weaker negative vortex. Many intense spiral vorticity filaments are created during this interaction and it is shown using a wavelet packet decomposition that, as has been suggested, the coherent vortex stabilizes the filaments. This result is confirmed by a linear stability analysis at the edge of the vortex and by a calculation of the straining induced by the spiral structure of the filament in the vortex core. The time-averaged energy spectra for simulations using hyper-viscosity and Newtonian viscosity have slopes of [minus sign]3 and [minus sign]4 respectively. Apart from a much higher effective Reynolds number (which accounts for the difference in energy spectra), the hyper-viscous simulation has the same dynamics as the Newtonian viscosity simulation. A wavelet packet decomposition of the hyper-viscous simulation reveals that after the merger the energy spectra of the filamentary and coherent parts of the vorticity field have slopes of [minus sign]2 and [minus sign]6 respectively. An asymptotic analysis and DNS for weak external strain shows that a circular filament at a distance R from the vortex centre always reduces the deformation of a Lamb's (Gaussian) vortex in the region r[gt-or-equal, slanted]R. In the region r{\{}$\backslash$lt{\}}R the deformation is also reduced provided the filament is intense and is in the vortex core, otherwise the filament may slightly increase the deformation. The results presented here should be useful for modelling the coherent and incoherent parts of two-dimensional turbulent flows. },

In particular, the conventional metrics of turbulence intensity and turbulent kinetic energy spectra only describe the turbulence at a point. Spatial information is required to estimate the loading across a rotor, for example, and to understand the short-term evolution of turbulence in the vicinity of a device (for potential use in feed-forward control algorithms). Here, we de- scribe a method to collect and analyze data for determining the spatial coherence of turbulence at marine hydrokinetic turbine deployment sites. The approach uses multiple compliant moor- ings equipped with acoustic Doppler velocimeters and inertial motion units. Analysis of data from previous deployments of a single mooring is used to demonstrate the method, and future de- ployments are discussed. It is expected that coherence will be highly dependent on scale, with high coherence for large-scale eddies, and low coherence for the smaller, inertial-scale eddies.},

The cross flow turbine uses this bi-directional flow to rotate in one direction only. The PTO system was experimented using a 6 DOF ocean simulator at a model to prototype scale of 1:3. The experiments were conducted for varying pitch angles, rotational speeds.

The premultiplied, one-dimensional spectrum of the streamwise velocity measured by hot-film anemometry has a bimodal distribution whose components are associated with large-scale motion and a range of smaller scales corresponding to the main turbulent motion. The characteristic wavelength of the large-scale mode increases through the logarithmic layer, and reaches a maximum value that is approximately 12–14 times the pipe radius, one order of magnitude longer than the largest reported integral length scale, and more than four to five times longer than the length of a turbulent bulge. The wavelength decreases to approximately two pipe radii at the pipe centerline. It is conjectured that the very large-scale motions result from the coherent alignment of large-scale motions in the form of turbulent bulges or packets of hairpin vortices.},

This paper aims to present a new approach for generating artificial velocity data which reproduces first and second order one point statistics as well as a locally given autocorrelation function. The method appears to be simple, flexible and more accurate than most of the existing methods. This is demonstrated in two cases. First, direct numerical simulations of planar turbulent jets in the Reynolds number range from 1000 to 6000 are performed. Because of the importance of the primary breakup mechanism of a liquid jet in which inflow influences are evident, the new procedure is secondly used, to study atomization in dependence of the flow inside the nozzle by means of a Volume of Fluid scheme.},

The Mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian (MEL) approach was adopted to capture the nonlinear free surfaces inside or outside the chamber. A special numerical treatment was applied on the chamber free surface boundary condition in order to consider the viscous energy loss due to BBDB shape and large motions. In order to realize the open-sea condition a special artificial damping scheme was applied to both the frontal area near the wave maker and the end-beach area. The damping scheme can dampen reflected waves and preserve incident waves. The free surface elevations inside or outside the chamber, interacted with a tuned viscous damping coefficient, were calculated for various incident wave conditions. Effects of body motions on the strength of viscous energy loss were investigated and proper damping coefficients were selected from the comparison of experimental data.},

Dynamic interaction of the disc with additional coupled, submerged inertias is used to minimize its oscillation. The method used to enable and extend this favorable dynamic coupling is discussed here. An oscillating water column in a submerged duct attached under a small circular opening in the disc and driven by the wave-field over the disc is used for wave energy conversion. Non-real-time reactive control of the water column response to enhance energy absorption is examined. The focusing effect of the submerged stationary disc is confirmed with numerical calculations of surface elevation over the disc. Hydrodynamic coefficients and exciting forces in the surge, heave, and pitch modes are computed numerically. Calculations of hydrodynamic performance suggest that energy absorption from the oscillating water column is significantly greater under control holding the disc stationary, and can be improved further by applying reactive loads tuned to the optimal susceptance and conductance associated with the oscillating water column. Also studied in this paper is the effect of submergence depth on the radiation and exciting force impulse response kernels and the prediction horizon for real time reactive control.},

abstract = {To measure large-scale flow structures in air, a tomographic particle
image velocimetry (tomographic PIV) system for measurement volumes of
the order of one cubic metre is developed, which employs helium-filled
soap bubbles (HFSBs) as tracer particles. The technique has several
specific characteristics compared to most conventional tomographic PIV
systems, which are usually applied to small measurement volumes. One of
them is spot lights on the HFSB tracers, which slightly change their
position, when the direction of observation is altered. Further issues
are the large particle to voxel ratio and the short focal length of the
used camera lenses, which result in a noticeable variation of the
magnification factor in volume depth direction. Taking the specific
characteristics of the HFSBs into account, the feasibility of our
large-scale tomographic PIV system is demonstrated by showing that the
calibration errors can be reduced down to 0.1 pixels as required.
Further, an accurate and fast implementation of the multiplicative
algebraic reconstruction technique, which calculates the weighting
coefficients when needed instead of storing them, is discussed. The
tomographic PIV system is applied to measure forced convection in a
convection cell at a Reynolds number of 530 based on the inlet channel
height and the mean inlet velocity. The size of the measurement volume
and the interrogation volumes amount to 750 mm x 450 mm x 165 mm and 48
mm x 48 mm x 24 mm, respectively. Validation of the tomographic PIV
technique employing HFSBs is further provided by comparing profiles of
the mean velocity and of the root mean square velocity fluctuations to
respective planar PIV data.},

Streamwise and wall-normal turbulence intensities and spectra are directly compared to corresponding laboratory data and similarity formulations hypothesized from the attached-eddy model of wall turbulence. This affords the opportunity to compare results with Reynolds numbers varying over three orders of magnitude. The wall-normal turbulence-intensity similarity formulation is extended. The results show good support for the similarity arguments forwarded by the attached-eddy model as well as Townsend's (1956) Reynolds-number similarity hypothesis and lack of the ‘inactive' motion influence on the wall-normal velocity component. The effects of wall roughness and the spread in the convection velocity due to this roughness are also discussed. 1.},

abstract = {Potential flow modeling of wind turbine aerodynamics has grown in popularity and offers a compromise between blade element momentum approaches and computational fluid dynamics in terms of both level of fidelity and computational cost. One important effect that can be modeled in potential flow is the blade-tower interaction. This paper focuses on how tower interference may be modeled for upwind-oriented turbines. A review of 2D and 3D models is given, and an incorrect formulation in a previously implemented 3D model is identified. A generalized and correct 3D model is proposed, and compared to two commonly used 2D models. The models are compared in terms of stagnation point location, and induced velocity. The vertical velocity component near the top of the tower is analyzed for the 3D model. The 3D model is contrasted with the 2D model in terms of the computational requirements, implementation and induced velocity field. Conclusions are drawn regarding the relevance of 3D modeling in the tower top region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Much of the published literature focusing on the performance assessment of arrays of Wave Energy Converters describes work carried out in analytical and numerical domains. Physical validation of these results using a wave basin has been identified as an urgent requirement in the wave energy industry. Unfortunately, physical modelling of array interactions using a wave basin is challenging because of the difficulties in replicating the characteristics of a numerical model. In particular, physical experiments and measurements are not completely repeatable and reproducible and so have uncertainty, which may impact validation where it is of the same order of magnitude as the array interactions to be measured. This paper describes the sources of these uncertainties together with procedures used to reduce their magnitude and ensure that the data collected is of a sufficiently high standard to allow the validation of numerical and analytical models. The paper concludes with a discussion summarising the findings and demonstrating the importance of understanding uncertainties by showing their potential effects on reportable results.},

abstract = {When dealing with the estimation of the power production of Wave Energy Converters (WECs), from either physical laboratory or numerical models, or measured data from sea testing of prototype, an accurate representation of the wave spectra at the target location is important for accurate power production estimates. This due to the typically highly frequencydependent response of the WECs. Depending on the location and other factors, sea spectral shapes may deviate significantly from standard spectra such as the JONSWAP, often assumed in such estimations. Here, a method for obtaining representative spectra for a particular location, based on sea wave measurements, is described, which allows a more accurate characterisation of the WEC performance. The analysis described here has been performed on wave data from a buoy at the location of DanWEC, approximately 1 nautical mile north of the Port of Hanstholm in Denmark. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a tool for both the analyses of the variance of the wave spectra, and for dimensionality reduction, before further analyses to find representative wave spectra. In this paper a PCA on approximately five years of 1D wave spectra records shows that approximately 90{\%} of the variance can be explained with only five parameters. Similar spectra are classified into k sets, with the k-means algorithm. The mean spectrum of each group can be used as representative spectra for physical laboratory testing or numerical modelling. An advantage of this approach is that no assumption is made about the shape of the spectra.},

First, it is found from the 3D simulation that the tip effect is considerable in terms of the efficiency of flapping foil with an aspect ratio of 5. Next, numerical results show that significant improvement is achieved in power efficiency by the given flexibility. Lastly, it is shown that the chord-wise flexure is more advantageous on power efficiency than span-wise flexure.

abstract = {It has been reported worldwide that muddy seafloors can extract a significant fraction of the energy stored in overpassing ocean waves within several wavelengths. We consider a synthetic-seabed-carpet, supported bymultiple springs and generators, that should extract wave energy the same way as muddy seafloor does. This paper presents the analytical model, the construction of the first working prototype and the experimental results of this novel concept called the Carpet of Wave Energy Conversion (CWEC).We successfully demonstrated its capability to absorb and convert wave energy for multiple sea states. As the CWEC operates completely submerged, it imposes no threat for overpassing ships and has no effect on oceanfront scenes. The CWEC's orientation combines the advantages of a point absorber, an attenuator and a terminator: it is wave- direction-independent, has a high absorption efficiency and can be exposed to high wave energy flux with its flexible spread perpendicular to the wave-propagation direction. The ability to cancel waves can be used to create safe zones in the ocean, prevent erosion and protect harbors. Secondly, the CWEC's primary energy conversion creates seawater at high pressure. This can be used to generate electricity, be used for desalination and for the distribution of fresh water. High pressure water can supply pumped-storage hydroelectric power plants, which are the most efficient way to balance the electrical grid.},

abstract = {Environmental impacts of proposed marine renewable schemes need to be understood. Typically, tide-only hydrodynamic models are employed to investigate the effect of proposed tidal energy converter arrays to sediment transport processes; however, storm waves are a very important process in the control and movement of these sandbanks. Twelve years of bathymetric data (1991-2002) from annual surveys of the Nash and Helwick sand banks in the Bristol Channel (UK) have been analysed. The inter-annual variability within storm wave events capable of erosion were calculated, and compared to the change in bathymetry at both sand banks. Such analysis indicated that the natural variability within storm wave events could be responsible for the observed inter-annual variability of sand bank volume and morphology. Therefore, surface waves should be included within a hydrodynamic model when determining the sediment transport impact of marine renewable schemes. Furthermore, the natural variability within a sandbank system needs be understood before the impact of a marine renewable scheme is determined.},

The accuracy of the calibrated algorithm was then assessed by comparing its results against measurements from a buoy located within the radar coverage area. Radar estimates and in-situ measurements showed good agreement. The calibrated algorithm revealed an improvement in terms of correlation coefficient and rmse as compared to the results obtained with the original regression coefficients, found during the EuroROSE Fedje experiment.

abstract = {Abstract A four-transducer, 600-kHz, broadband acoustic Dopple current profiler (ADCP) was rigidly mounted to the bottom of a fully turbulent tidal channel with peak flows of 1 m s?1. Rapid samples of velocity data are used to estimate various parameters of turbulence with the covariance technique. The questions of bias and error sources, statistical uncertainty, and spectra are addressed. Estimates of the Reynolds stress are biased by the misalignment of the instrument axis with respect to vertical. This bias can be eliminated by a fifth transducer directed along the instrument axis. The estimates of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) density have a systematic bias of 5 ? 10?4 m2 s?2 due to Doppler noise, and the relative statistical uncertainty of the 20-min averages is usually less than 20{\%}?95{\%} confidence. The bias in the Reynolds stress due to Doppler noise is less than ±4 ? 10?5 m2. The band of zero significance is never less than 1.5 ? 10?5 m2 s?2 due to Doppler noise, and this band increases with increasing TKE density. Velocity fluctuations with periods longer than 20 min contribute little to either the stress or the TKE density. The rate of production of TKE density and the vertical eddy viscosity are derived and in agreement with expectations for a tidal channel.},

abstract = {Abstract A broadband ADCP and a moored microstructure instrument (TAMI) were deployed in a tidal channel of 30-m depth and with peak speeds of 1 m s?1. The measurements enable us to derive profiles of stress, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), the rate of production and dissipation of TKE, eddy viscosity, diffusivity, as well as mixing length, and to test the parameterization of dissipation rate in the model of Mellor and Yamada. At middepth in the channel where the influence of stratification was present, the Ellison length agrees with the Ozmidov length. The measured mixing length is smaller than the simple z-dependence formulation proposed for unstratified turbulence. The diffusivity of density and heat, and the viscosity for momentum, are correlated and comparable in magnitudes. The 20-min averaged production rate deduced from the ADCP agrees with the dissipation rate estimated from microstructure measurements. The dissipation rate calculated with the Mellor?Yamada model agrees with the measured values with TAMI, but the empirical constant B1 derived from the data is larger than that conventionally used in the model. In the near-bottom layer, there is a tight correlation between the production rate and the closure-based dissipation rate. The Reynolds stress at 3.6 m above the bottom is consistently 2.5 times smaller than the shear velocity squared (u2?), which is inferred from fitting the velocity profiles to a logarithmic form. A logarithmic velocity profile almost always exists and reaches heights of 5.6 to 20 m, but the Reynolds stress is seldom constant in any part of the logarithmic layer.},

abstract = {Surface gravity waves can significantly impact operating conditions for a marine current turbine, imparting unsteady velocities several orders of magnitude larger than the ambient turbulence. The influence of surface waves on the performance characteristics of a two-bladed horizontal axis marine current turbine was investigated experimentally in a large towing tank facility at the United States Naval Academy. The turbine model had a 0.8 m diameter (D) rotor with a NACA 63-618 cross section, which is Reynolds number independent with respect to lift coefficient in the operating range of Rec 4 x 105. The torque, thrust and rotational speed were measured at a range of tip speed ratios (TSR) from 5 {\textless} TSR {\textless} 11. Tests were performed at two rotor depths (1.3D and 2.25D) with and without waves. The average turbine performance characteristics were largely unchanged by depth or the presence of waves. However, tests with waves indicate large variations in thrust, rotational speed, and torque occurred with the passage of the wave. These results demonstrate the impact of surface gravity waves on power production and structural loading and suggest that turbines should be positioned vertically within the water column at a depth which maximizes power output while minimizing material fatigue.},

abstract = {The work presented in this paper represents an experimental
investigation into secondary flows, turbulent boundary layers and the
interaction of the two as they develop in a zero-pressure-gradient
rotating flow field. A duct of intermediate aspect ratio was used to
examine secondary flows and determine when they begin to govern the
boundary layer development. The aspect ratio (A) was defined as duct
height/width at the upstream end of the working section. Measurements
were taken at three aspect ratios: A = 1, 2 and 4.
A qualitative indication of secondary flow strength was established
with mean-cross-stream-plane velocity measurements. A first-order
analysis of the secondary flow is presented which provides a reasonable
estimation of their strength. Mid-span mean-flow, turbulence and
spectra profiles were measured on the duct walls parallel to the axis
of rotation. Results are generally presented for A = 2 and 1. For A = 4
and 2 there were minor effects of secondary flows observed on the
mid-span mean flow parameters. The turbulent shear measurements showed
some secondary flow effect for A = 2. All turbulence and mean-flow
quantities were strongly affected by secondary flows for A = 1. Spectra
results presented for A = 2 showed most variation at the low-to-mid
wavenumber end. Spectra results for A = 1 showed a bodily shift of the
whole spectrum towards low wavenumber on the pressure side and high
wavenumber on the suction side.},

The test programme comprised radiation tests, where the power take-off (PTO) of one model was excited in initially calm water and the effects of the radiated waves on the other models were measured, and also tests in regular and irregular waves. The radiation tests showed that the effect of reflected wave components (due to the presence of the tank walls) on the models was of a similar magnitude to the array interactions. Comparisons with WaveDyn results showed that the effects of radiated waves could be accurately reproduced. The regular wave tests were analysed in a way that excludes the effect of reflected waves, so that only clear array interactions are visible. Comparisons showed good agreement between the tank and numerical results at most frequencies. The irregular wave tests exhibit a smaller level of array interactions due to the combined positive and negative effects of waves at multiple frequencies. The effect of reflected waves on the comparisons between tank and numerical results in irregular waves is shown to have a significant effect on the uncertainty.},

Wave conditions over 2 years (From January 2009 to December 2010) were produced using Delft3D-Wave (a version of SWAN embedded within the Delft3D modelling suite) at different locations around Guernsey. The model was forced with WaveWatchIII (WWIII) model data at a point with a latitude of 49.530, a longitude of -2.940, a depth of 77m, and at 3 hourly intervals for the 2-year study period. Model validations with data by the same WWIII model at a grid point with a latitude of 49.530, a longitude of -2.770, and a depth a 66m, at 3-hourly intervals and for the same 2-year period, showed an extremely good agreement between model predictions and WWIII data. The boundary conditions data and the model validation data were kindly provided by the Met Office for this particular project. A constant mean sea level was assumed. Computations of monthly and mean available power output throughout the study area for the 2-year period highlighted three regions, two near the 12NM limit, and one very near the Island itself, where maximum mean power outputs were of the order of 24 kW/m. This mean power output is similar to that at the WaveHub site, off the north coast of Cornwall, being developed as a Wave Energy test facility due to its excellent wave energy conversion potential.},

This idea had a profound impact in mathematical analysis, physics and engineering, but it took one and a half centuries to understand the convergence of Fourier series and complete the theory of Fourier integrals. Fourier was motivated by the study of heat diffusion, which is governed by a linear differential equation. However, the Fourier transform diagonalizes all linear time-invariant operators, which are the building blocks of signal processing. It is, therefore, not only the starting point of our exploration but the basis of all further developments. Two -dimensional Fourier Transform is a straightforward extension of the one-dimensional Fourier transform. The two-dimensional case is briefly reviewed for image processing applications.},

abstract = {This study presents the modeling and analysis of an ESS (energy storage system) for a TEC (tidal energy converter) to be installed in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. The electricity distribution grid that services the region has a minimum annual electricity demand of 0.9MW. Policy limits the installation of renewable electricity generators to 0.9MW at this site. An existing 0.9MW WEC (wind energy converter) occupies this capacity, inhibiting further installations. The use of an ESS enables the installation of a 0.5MW TEC by ensuring the combined electricity output from WEC and TEC does not exceed 0.9MW. The objective of this study is to model the system and determine the characteristics of the ESS capacity, power, and cyclic nature. The WEC and TEC are modeled based on measured and simulated wind and tidal speed data respectively. An ESS is modeled to de-couple the TEC output from the grid demand. A curtailment analysis is conducted for various ESS capacity and power sizes to determine the economic benefit. Avoidance of all curtailment requires nearly 7MWh of storage. Significant economic benefit may be found by reducing the ESS to less than 3MWh, resulting in minor curtailment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results of this analysis exhibited a 3.6{\%} change in thrust for a rapid pitch case and a slight change in amplitude and phase of thrust for a case with 30° of yaw.},

abstract = {Modelling of the complete second-order structure of homogeneous, neutrally stratified atmospheric boundary-layer turbulence, including spectra of all velocity components and cross-spectra of any combination of velocity components at two arbitrarily chosen points, is attempted. Two models based on Rapid Distortion Theory (RDT) are investigated. Both models assume the velocity profile in the height interval of interest to be approximately linear. The linearized Navier-Stokes equation together with considerations of ‘eddy' lifetimes are then used to modify the spatial second-order structure of the turbulence. The second model differs from the first by modelling the blocking by the surface in addition to the shear. The resulting models of the spectral velocity tensor contain only three adjustable parameters : a lengthscale describing the size of the largest energy-containing eddies, a non-dimensional number used in the parametrization of ‘eddy' lifetime, and the third parameter is a measure of the energy dissipation. Two atmospheric experiments, both designed to investigate the spatial structure of turbulence and both running for approximately one year, are used to test and calibrate the models. Even though the approximations leading to the models are very crude they are capable of predicting well the two-point second-order statistics such as cross-spectra, coherences and phases, on the basis of measurements carried out at one point. The two models give very similar predictions, the largest difference being in the coherences involving vertical velocity fluctuations, where the blocking by the surface seems to have a significan! effect},

The method is based on a model of the spectral tensor for atmospheric surface-layer turbulence at high wind speeds and can simulate two- or three-dimensional fields of one, two or three components of the wind velocity fluctuations. The spectral tensor is compared with and adjusted to several spectral models commonly used in wind engineering. Compared to the Sandia method (see Veers, P. S., Three-dimensional wind simulation. Technical Report SAND88-0152, Sandia National Laboratories, 1988) the algorithm is more efficient, simpler to implement, and in some respects more physical.

The resulting equations are implemented in a computer code using the mean flow generated by a linear mean flow model as input. It estimates turbulence structure over hills (except on the lee side if recirculation is present) in the so-called outer layer and also models the changes in turbulence statistics in the vicinity roughness changes. Comparison of the model with atmospheric data shows a reasonable agreement. However, there is certainly room for improvements. The modeled turbulence statistics or simulated fields are suitable as input for dynamic load calculations on wind turbines and other tall structures and is under implementation in the collection of programs called WAsP Engineering.},

abstract = {In recent years, the successful realization and operation of tidal turbine prototypes has increasingly confronted engineers with marine environments that consist of high current velocities that may occur simultaneously with large wave scenarios. The complex flow field associated with such conditions makes the design of offshore foundations a particularly challenging task. In this paper, numerical methods based on Computational Fluid Dynamics are described and applied to a shape optimal design study of a gravity base foundation. The structure is analyzed for pure wave, pure current, and combined wave-current-loading. It is shown that the optimal design with respect to a minimization of horizontal forces may vary depending on the prevailing marine environments at the offshore site. Furthermore, attention is drawn to the influence of wave-current interaction on the resulting forces. Under certain conditions, the data predict a significant load increase compared to a linear superposition of pure wave and pure current-loading. It is shown that a great optimization potential for reliable structures is gained when the predominant offshore conditions are modeled accurately.},

abstract = {Although many wave energy projects have been designed only a few of them have been tested with success under real conditions. Over the last three years Wavestar has systematically collected and published real-sea operational and performance data from the Wavestar demonstrator in the North Sea, giving an indication of the achievements of the demonstrator in three main criteria of success: predictability, performance and reliability. Currently Wavestar focuses on the development of offshore wind/wave farms with bottom fixed foundations in water depths of 10 to 30 metres. However, on the longer run the wind turbine technology is expected to develop for use in deeper waters using floating foundations, and when this industry is mature Wavestar will start developing floating wave energy converters. The combination of Wavestar converters and offshore wind turbines offers attractive energy prices. Energy production from a wind/wave farm is increased and power fluctuations are reduced which increases the value of the produced energy. Further potential synergies of combining wind and wave energy in the same area include cost savings e.g. by sharing infrastructure costs as well as operations and maintenance facilities. This paper describes the vision and plans for the introduction of the Wavestar wave energy converter concept on the European market. A business strategy through a consortium or other form of collaboration with industrial partners, investors and customers is essential for a successful market breakthrough. Further, the factors influencing the economic strategic model and political aspects are discussed as industrial growth and employment are the key success factors for the implementation of a new innovative industry.},

The experiments involved static and dynamic tests, where airfoil motion was of plunging type oscillation. The application of surface grit roughness simulates surface irregularities that occur on the wind turbine blades. The measurements showed that increasing the angle of attack results in movement of transition locations toward the leading edge. Surface roughness moved the transition point toward the leading edge and caused early trailing edge turbulent separation, which resulted in reducing the effectiveness of the airfoil.

abstract = {This paper presents the predicted effect of realistic velocity profiles on a 1MW tidal stream turbine (TST) using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A baseline study using a uniform onset velocity and low turbulence intensity is first performed. The effects of realistic flow conditions typical of Flood and Ebb tides are then modelled using velocity profiles based on field measurements recorded at the EMEC test site. The effect of these different flow conditions are assessed through instantaneous and mean quantities of power and thrust coefficients. Both coefficients are related to average velocity across the turbines swept area, which is 2{\%} and 3{\%} greater than the uniform flow for the flood and ebb profiles respectively. An effect of the velocity profiles is that the power coefficient is increased, by 1{\%} and 2.7{\%} for the flood and ebb velocity profiles respectively. To assess the influence of the mast and depth-varying velocity on individual blades the instantaneous loading is investigated. For the baseline uniform flow study the mast causes some variation in the instantaneous blade loads over a range that is 4{\%} of the mean. Increased levels of turbulence are shown to have little effect on the mean power and thrust coefficients whilst causing the immediate wake to recover much more rapidly.},

abstract = {In recent years a number of programs have been carried out with the purpose of investigating wake effects at Horns Rev offshore wind farm. The latest Danish project “Large wind farms shadow: measurements and data analyses” aims to map the downstream effect of large wind farms, and includes monitoring the in-park wake effects. The wind farm considered, Horns Rev, has an installed capacity of 160 MW. Approximately one years data are available after the final completion of the Horns Rev turbines, this paper presents the first analysis based on a large amount of data from the Horns Rev wind farm in operation. The data for the current paper are acquired partly from the meteorological masts positioned north west and east of Horns Rev and from the SCADA database, which contains all observed data from the turbines at both wind farms. This paper presents analysis of the power output in a row of operating turbines and the dependency on wind direction relative to the row direction. The aim is to describe the magnitude of the wake effects and give an indication of the importance of wind direction. For the majority of the selected cases the turbines were operating at wind speeds with high rotor thrust. Comparison of the results for different spacing at Horns Rev (along rows and columns and for diagonal spacing) will provide insight to the mechanism of wake development and expansion. Part of the project involves development of a model based on the analytical solutions of wake development described by Frandsen et al. (2004). This model is currently being operationalised Horns Rev and results from the modelling will be compared with the data analysis. The objective is to illustrate whether the merging of wakes within large wind farms can be described by simple linear models or whether the inclusion of the two-way interaction between the wind turbines and the boundary-layer is a necessary prerequisite for accurate models of wakes to be used in future wind farm design.},

abstract = {A PIV algorithm is presented for estimating time-averaged or phase-averaged velocity fields. The algorithm can be applied to situations where signal strength is not sufficient for standard cross correlation techniques, such as a low number of particle images in an interrogation spot, or poor image quality. The algorithm can also be used to increase the spatial resolution of measurements by allowing smaller interrogation spots than those required for standard cross correlation techniques. The quality of the velocity measurements can be dramatically increased by averaging a series of instantaneous correlation functions, before determining the location of the signal peak, as opposed to the commonly used technique of estimating instantaneous velocity fields first and then averaging the velocity fields. The algorithm is applied to a 30 mm3300 mm microchannel flow.},

abstract = {Many fundamental and intrinsic properties of small-scale motions in turbulence can be described using the velocity gradient tensor. This tensor encodes interesting geometric and statistical information such as the alignment of vorticity with respect to the strain-rate eigenvectors, rate of deformation and shapes of fluid material volumes, non-Gaussian statistics, and intermittency. In the inertial range of turbulence, similar properties can be described using the coarse-grained or filtered velocity gradient tensor. In this article we review various models that aim at understanding these phenomena using a small number of ordinary differential equations, written either as a low-dimensional dynamical system or as a set of stochastic differential equations. Typically these describe the Lagrangian evolution of the velocity gradient tensor elements following fluid particles and require models for the pressure Hessian and viscous effects. Sample results from various models are shown, and open challenges are high...},

abstract = {A survey is conducted to quantitatively visualise the wake flow behind a circular cylinder at Reynolds numbers of 180 to 2500. A time-resolved tomographic PIV method is used to measure the sequence of three-dimensional vector fields evolving in time. The attention is focused upon the unsteady 3D wake organization with the interaction of primary rollers (Karman-Benard) and the secondary vortices resulting from 3D instability of the vortex wake. A cylinder of 12 mm diameter is immersed in a water channel of 600600 mm2 test section of which only the upper half channel is used. A volume of 805016 mm3 is illuminated by a 2200 mJ laser and recorded by 4 cameras with 2k2k pixels viewing the volume from different directions distributed over a solid angle of 45 degrees. The images are processed by a modified MART tomographic reconstruction algorithm to first reconstruct the intensities of all voxels in the illuminated volume. The volume reconstruction is followed by a three-dimensional cross-correlation between interrogation volumes returning approximately 300.000 vectors at every snapshot. At low free-stream velocity, the recording system is operated in continuous-mode achieving a recording rate of 20 Hz, which provides time-sequences with higher temporal resolution. However, at velocities exceeding 5 cm/s only acquisition in double-frame mode can ensure the appropriate time separation for cross-correlation. Nevertheless, the time resolution is sufficient for the description of dynamic events up to a flow speed of 15 cm/s. To the authors knowledge, this type of measurement is unprecedented: for the first time it has been possible to measure small-scale 3D-flow features in a complete volume time-resolved with high spatial resolution. Sample results are presented showing the evolution of spanwise vortices and pairs of counter-rotating secondary interconnecting structures, characterized by different spacing as a function of the Reynolds number. The high-computational load for data processing keeps the investigation still in progress at present time.},

abstract = {Based on the bi-directional operating principle of the axial Wells turbine, a radial turbine was suggested by KENTFIELD in the 1980ies, but never investigated in detail. As compared to the axial Wells turbine advantages are thought to be reduced secondary flow effects and hence increased operating range and peak efficiency. This paper deals with a first numerical (RANS) investigation of aerodynamically almost equivalent threedimensional axial and radial lift-based blade cascades for bidirectional flow and a comparison to a two-dimensional cascade. The comparison reveals that the radial turbine has a potential of improved peak efficiency and stall-free operating range as compared to the axial Wells turbine. It turned out that the meridional contour in the vicinity of the radial blade cascade has a major impact on the performance. By controlling the meridional throughflow area one can achieve an almost similar performance as well as for centrifugal and centripetal flow direction. Comparing with the ideal 2D cascade one may conclude that there is still some potential for improving especially the operation range of the radial cascade.},

A turbine concept which has never been investigated in detail is a bi-directional radial turbine as suggested by KENTFIELD (1983). This paper presents an analytical design method for a bi-directional radial lift-based (BiRLi) OWC turbine. The blade cascade design is based on a blade element momentum (BEM) method combined with WEINIG'S cascade correction. Employing the design method, a full BiRLi turbine layout, including the blade cascade, a set of guide vanes and the meridional contour is designed. Three dimensional steady state RANS simulations of the BiRLi turbine from no-load to near stall are carried out to show the performance and flow characteristics as well as to validate the BEM design of the turbine. It is shown that the performance of a first investigated BiRLi turbine design is promising to be an alternative to the turbine concepts presently in place.},

abstract = {The shore mounted “Pico” OWC has a relief valve mounted in parallel to the turbine which connects the chamber to the atmosphere. The aperture of this valve is adjustable and can be used to regulate the pneumatic power exposed to the turbine. Here we develop an algorithm to actively control the relief valve aperture so that the peak pneumatic power of each wave cycle approaches but does not breach the turbine stall threshold, thus providing the maximum pneumatic power possible without the turbine stalling. The relief valve aperture is slow to adjust so the hydrodynamic and pneumatic behaviour is forecasted to allow enough time to achieve the correct aperture before the wave reaches the chamber. The chamber hydrodynamics are forecasted using a neural network that considers hydrodynamic measurements made 60 meters up wave and other operational, environmental and preceding wave, parameters. Turbine stalls were identified approximately by the gradient in turbine vibration and the angular velocity dependent pneumatic power threshold for turbine stall is found empirically. The relationship between the forecasted chamber hydrodynamics, relief valve aperture and the resultant pneumatic behaviour, is also found empirically and this is used to select the relief valve aperture that the control algorithm targets.},

abstract = {In order to meet the increasing demand for energy from renewable sources, the UK is being encouraged towards offshore array deployments and marine energy parks. The pressure to perform efficient, timely and cost effective marine operations consequently increases. Central to success is the accessibility of the site by suitable installation vessels and associated with this is the availability of appropriate weather windows, subsequently, via careful planning, the reduction of downtime and its associated cost. There are a number of methods in existence which analyse the likelihood of accessible conditions occurring; however few methods sufficiently address complete, complex installation operations and vessel selection. Furthermore there exists a shortage of cost effective, appropriate installation vessels, particularly when seeking those capable of working in severe tidal currents. Efficient utilisation of available resource is therefore essential. This work discusses two, complementary, solutions to these problems. Firstly a software package that has been specifically engineered for the analysis and optimisation of marine energy installations, Mermaid (Marine Economic Risk Management Aid). The second is a fit-for-purpose vessel designed specifically to perform optimally during installation, maintenance and decommissioning of marine energy devices - the HiFlo-4 Installation Vessel (HF4). Herein Mermaid is applied to a case study tidal energy array installation, demonstrating the methods which may be used to optimise the process, ultimately achieving a reduction in capital expenditure. Throughout this analysis traditional offshore construction vessels are considered alongside the HF4. This process demonstrates the importance of performing a thorough weather risk analysis, and of selecting the most suitable tools and methods for the task at hand. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {AeroDyn is a set of routines used in conjunction with an aeroelastic simulation code to predict the aerodynamics of horizontal axis wind turbines. These subroutines provide several different models whose theoretical bases are described in this manual. AeroDyn contains two models for calculating the effect of wind turbine wakes: the blade element momentum theory and the generalized dynamic-wake theory. Blade element momentum theory is the classical standard used by many wind turbine designers and generalized dynamic wake theory is a more recent model useful for modeling skewed and unsteady wake dynamics. When using the blade element momentum theory, various corrections are available for the user, such as incorporating the aerodynamic effects of tip losses, hub losses, and skewed wakes. With the generalized dynamic wake, all of these effects are automatically included. Both of these methods are used to calculate the axial induced velocities from the wake in the rotor plane. The user also has the option of calculating the rotational induced velocity. In addition, AeroDyn contains an important model for dynamic stall based on the semi-empirical Beddoes-Leishman model. This model is particularly important for yawed wind turbines. Another aerodynamic model in AeroDyn is a tower shadow model based on potential flow around a cylinder and an expanding wake. Finally, AeroDyn has the ability to read several different formats of wind input, including single-point hub-height wind files or multiple-point turbulent winds. i},

Using computational fluid dynamics the paper shows the non dimensional swirl number for a 2, 3 and 4 bladed TST. The characteristics of velocities, pressure drop, viscosity are described for the 3 bladed TST. To ensure the validity of the data sets the characteristics are compared to the findings in the literature for a set of generic swirl generators. The swirl number for the TSTs in a 3.08 m/s tidal (uniform) flow was found to range between 0.168 and 0.263, which describes weak swirl flow. Whilst the characteristics are in agreement with theory it also means that the swirl component of the wake is not coupled with the axial component at the lower swirl numbers and cannot be used to estimate the wake length.},

abstract = {The nature of the interaction between the inner and outer regions of turbulent wall-bounded flow is examined. Townsend's theory of inactive motion is shown to be a first-order, linear approximation of the effect of the large eddies at the surface that acts as a quasi-inviscid, low-frequency modulation of the shear-stress-bearing motion. This is shown to be a 'strong' asymptotic condition that directly expresses the decoupling of the inner-scale active motion from the outer-scale inactive motion. It is further shown that such a decoupling of the inner and outer vorticity fields near the wall is inappropriate, even at high Reynolds numbers, and that a 'weak' asymptotic condition is required to represent the increasing effect of outer-scale influences as the Reynolds number increases. High Reynolds number data from a fully developed pipe flow and the atmospheric surface layer are used to show that the large-scale motion penetrates to the wall, the inner-outer interaction is not describable as a linear process and the interaction should more generally be accepted as an intrinsically nonlinear one.},

None of the existing guidelines satisfy the needs of wave energy devices. These guidelines do not consider the working principles of the devices, are too demanding as to safety or too simple and lead to expensive solutions. Wave energy devices will require a new set of design guidelines containing a new low consequence class, since mooring failure will not lead to “unacceptable consequences such as loss of life and uncontrolled outflow of oil or gas”. It should be up to the owner, insurance company and investors to balance their economic risks above a certain minimum safety level. A deeper analysis of mooring systems for ocean energy devices, compared to what is demanded for offshore oil and gas platforms, is required to properly assess the effect on the power take-off and survivability, the latter leading to economical benefits from a possible low consequence class},

abstract = {During the wind turbine design process different simulation tools are used. All of them require a simulated wind field as input. Thus, it is very important to have wind field models which are realistic, especially to ensure the reliability of results from a numerical wind turbine model. In this paper, we analyse offshore wind time series measured at FINO1 at three different heights. The statistical properties are calculated and compared with the theoretical values commonly used in the standard wind field models. Confor- mities as well as deviations between the meas- urements and models are carved out and are presented. Additionally, synthetic wind fields were generated using the built in wind field gen- eration tool in the GH Bladed software. The pa- rameters for the turbulence models were chosen to match the analysed characteristics of the FINO1 data. A load analysis of simulations car- ried out for the OC3 wind turbine for some key parameters show striking differences in the re- sulting loads.},

abstract = {The rotor of an in-stream tidal turbine is the sole component which extracts power from the tidal flow, therefore optimization of turbine blade designs can result in more effective tidal extraction. Horizontal axis tidal turbines (HATT) typically have fixed pitch (FP) or variable pitch (VP) blades. Although FP blades require less maintenance and are typically less expensive than VP blades, they are limited to optimal performance at a specific tip speed ratio (TSR) and are exposed to high thrust loads at flow speeds above the design speed. Investigations have shown that active VP mechanisms improve the energy output of a device considerably and can decrease blade loads and power output at high flow speeds, however, they are complex and expensive. This paper sets out to report the outcomes of research being undertaken into rotor blades which self-adapt to varying flow conditions, called passively adaptive blades. Non-homogeneous tailored composite materials are being explored as a way to adapt the blade to operating conditions such that the angle of attack changes as a function of blade loading. This can potentially reduce the dynamic blade and structural loads and result in a predictable peak level of power above the design flow speed.},

abstract = {Ambient turbulent flow structures are one of the key drivers that will determine the rate of wake recovery downstream of tidal turbines. For second and third generation arrays or farms such a parameter is critical for the determination of inter-device spacing and the optimisation of energy extraction per unit surface area. At present offshore flow characterisation is dominated by seabed or surface-mounted diverging-beam acoustic Doppler profilers that whilst having a good spatial capture cannot characterise turbulent flow structures to the same accuracy as single point converging laboratory-scale velocimeters. So a paradox presently exists: We can measure the (mean) flow characteristics at real tidal energy sites but lack the ability to accuracy ascertain high-frequency flow characteristic at discrete spatial locations. This is possible at laboratory-scale with convergent-beam devices but as we do not know the real site conditions replication at small-scale can only be approximated. To date there has been few laboratory studies where the ambient flow turbulence has been varied. The standard method is to generate turbulence from a static structure such as a grid. Here we have developed an articulated rig that has the ability to oscillate cylindrical members along two axes in the flow upstream of tidal turbine models. Initial results presented in this paper show the effect upon the ambient flow that the turbulencegenerating rig can impose and the effects upon wake dissipation for varying levels of turbulent length and time scales. Also the formation and insistence of turbulent structures shed from the device are reported. As expected increasing ambient turbulence intensity serves to dissipate the turbine wake more rapidly and whilst we cannot directly relate these laboratory flow characteristics to full-scale tidal energy sites at present it is hoped that offshore measurement technology and that of laboratory replication can converge so that device performance prediction can be performed at smaller-scale and at a corresponding lower cost to the technology.},

abstract = {Our aim in this paper is to present a brief overview of the scaled hydrokinetic turbine model testing activities in the United States using test turbines specifically designed by the US Department of Energy for its Marine and Hydrokinetic Research and Development program. These test turbines include: (1) a three-bladed horizontal axis turbine (the Sandia turbine) that was designed to demonstrate small scale verification and validation turbine design assessment; and (2) reference tidal and river turbines that were designed to develop baseline levelized cost of energy estimates. These scaled model turbine tests are generating performance and flow field data sets that will be fully documented and disseminated to the public. These data sets will enable MHK developers and researchers to validate their hydrokinetic turbine design and analysis models. In this paper, we present experimental results for two test turbines, including the scaled-model tests of the Sandia horizontal-axis turbine and the DOE's reference river turbine. For the Sandia turbine tests, we compare experimental measurements with mid- and high-fidelity hydrodynamic models and demonstrate their validity as design and analysis tools. The scaled model testing of DOE's reference tidal and river turbines should be completed by the end of this year, with performance and flow field measurements available to the public in 2014.},

abstract = {Regional assessments of the wave energy resource tend to focus on averaged quantities, and so provide potential developers with no sense of temporal variability beyond seasonal means. In particular, such assessments give no indication of inter-annual variability - something that is critical for determining the potential of a region for wave energy convertor (WEC) technology. Here, we apply the third-generation wave model SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) at high resolution to assess the wave resource of the northwest European shelf seas, an area where many wave energy test sites exist, and where many wave energy projects are under development. The model is applied to 7. years of wind forcing (2005-2011), a time period which witnessed considerable extremes in the variability of the wind (and hence wave) climate, as evidenced by the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Our simulations demonstrate that there is much greater uncertainty in the NW European shelf wave resource during October-March, in contrast to the period April-September. In the more energetic regions of the NW European shelf seas, e.g. to the northwest of Scotland, the uncertainty was considerably greater. The winter NW European shelf wave power resource correlated well with the NAO. Therefore, provided trends in the NAO can be identified over the coming decades, it may be possible to estimate how the European wave resource will similarly vary over this time period. Finally, the magnitude of wave power estimated by this study is around 10{\%} lower than a resource which is used extensively by the wave energy sector - the Atlas of UK Marine Renewable Energy Resources. Although this can partly be explained by different time periods analysed for each study, our application of a third-generation wave model at high spatial and spectral resolution significantly improves the representation of the physical processes, particularly the non-linear wave-wave interactions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

An appropriate functional form for the mean velocity profile is developed and used to parameterize available data. A physical model for the parametric variation with pressure gradient is then developed. This model is based on the concept of a universal critical Reynolds number for the sublayer which explains (both qualitatively and quantitatively) the variation of the important parameters in the inner flow. In particular this gives an explanation for the shift in the apparent log-law due to pressure-gradient effects and provides an appropriate scaling for the Reynolds stresses. It is shown that this model is not only physically plausible but is also consistent with the available data.},

The project was funded by the Danish Energy Agency's EUDP programme. By 2030 at the latest, the development of wave energy technology will provide a cost-effective and sustainable electricity supply from offshore energy farms in Denmark. The strategy assumes that wave energy in combinations with wind farms will become more cost-effective than off-shore wind power, placed in deep sea far from shore and that the development will take place through an extended cooperation revolving around the technology development and supported by improved financial conditions for wave energy. The vision that the Danish wave energy industry will be able to sell competitive wave energy technologies both on the national and the international market and that utilization of wave energy will become a prerequisite for building offshore energy farms at greater water depths in the future, is the key reason for suggesting improved financial conditions for wave energy.

abstract = {A novel technique to increase the accuracy of multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique$\backslash$n(MART) reconstruction from tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) recordings at higher seeding$\backslash$ndensity than currently possible is presented. The motion tracking enhancement (MTE) method is based$\backslash$non the combined utilization of images from two or more exposures to enhance the reconstruction of$\backslash$nindividual intensity fields. The working principle is first introduced qualitatively, and the$\backslash$nmathematical background is given that explains how the MART reconstruction can be improved on the$\backslash$nbasis of an improved first guess object obtained from the combination of non-simultaneous views$\backslash$nreduced to the same time instant deforming the 3D objects by an estimate of the particle motion$\backslash$nfield. The performances of MTE are quantitatively evaluated by numerical simulation of the imaging,$\backslash$nreconstruction and image correlation processes. The cases of two or more exposures obtained from$\backslash$ntime-resolved experiments are considered. The iterative application of MTE appears to significantly$\backslash$nimprove the reconstruction quality, first by decreasing the intensity of the ghost images and$\backslash$nsecond, by increasing the intensity and the reconstruction precision for the actual particles. Based$\backslash$non computer simulations, the maximum imaged seeding density that can be dealt with is tripled with$\backslash$nrespect to the MART analysis applied to a single exposure. The analysis also illustrates that the$\backslash$nmaximum effect of the MTE method is comparable to that of doubling the number of cameras in the$\backslash$ntomographic system. Experiments performed on a transitional jet at Re = 5000 apply the MTE method to$\backslash$ndouble-frame recordings. The velocity measurement precision is increased for a system with fewer$\backslash$nviews (two or three cameras compared with four cameras). The ghost particles' intensity is also$\backslash$nvisibly reduced although to a lesser extent with respect to the computer simulations. The velocity$\backslash$nand vorticity field obtained from a three-camera reconstruction with MTE are equivalent to that from$\backslash$na four-camera analysis. Possible variants of the MTE algorithm are investigated based on a first$\backslash$nguess obtained by average or by product of pseudo-simultaneous objects (PSO), which potentially$\backslash$noffer a higher convergence rate.},

abstract = {Energy production estimate (EPE) uncertainty categories developed for onshore wind energy have good application when applied to wave and tidal energy. In broad terms wave and tidal EPE uncertainty is split between uncertainty in the resource before it meets the marine energy converter (MEC), and uncertainty due to energy losses between the MEC and the electricity metering point. In order to combine these two uncertainties, the resource uncertainty must be converted to an equivalent energy uncertainty, using sensitivity coefficients. This paper examines the characteristics of sensitivity coefficients for various combinations of resource levels in combination with various (nominal) MEC power functions, for both wave and tidal energy converters. Further the paper explores the practical implications on MEC design when setting MEC power ratings to minimize sensitivity coefficients for a given resource. For context, the paper initially considers the theory of error propagation, and particular consideration is given to the validity of an assumption, prevalent in wind EPEs, of normally distributed errors on input variables.},

abstract = {Temporal and spatial variability of the wave field are key issues in the assessment of wave energy resources, specially when we need to focus in local areas. Nevertheless, long term tendencies and results from wave climate projections are also considered of relevance to schedules and plan for operation and maintenance. Long-term wave spectra simulation and shortperiod in situ records of the wave field are used to determine the variability of the most important wave characteristics in order to study their possible influence on the estimated energy potentially available in the Pacific coastal region off the Baja California peninsula in Mexico. A third generation spectral wave model (WAM) has been applied over practically the whole Pacific Ocean, using NCEP surface wind re-analysis as forcing fields, and hindcast results are obtained for oceanic scale runs (1o x 1o resolution). Smaller scale and finer resolution results are obtained by nested grids and the use of the SWAN model. Unstructured grids were further used with the SWAN model in the coastal region for local scale simulations. An important issue is the wider range of frequencies resolved by the models compared with standard runs already reported elsewhere, in order to better reproduce relevant processes in coastal regions such as non-linear interactions and changes in directional spreading of the wave spectrum. Detailed analysis of time variability of the wave field is performed and the potential impact on the estimation of extreme values is assessed. Long term tendencies of wave parameters are discussed within the context of the oceanic scale simulations of the wave phenomenon and their implications on the wave energy resources assessment is also addressed. Significant wave height variability is associated with decadal climate variations and other low frequency oscillation indicators such as ENSO (El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation), NAOI (North Atlantic Oscillation Index) and NPOI (North Pacific Oscillation Index). Long term tendencies of significant wave heights are analyzed in order to determine the effect of the time series lengths being used as well as discriminating among mean, extreme and maximum significant wave heights.},

The purpose of these experiments was to improve understanding of the relationships between the bursting of low-speed streaks near the wall and the flow field farther away from the wall. On the basis of these observations, it seems that (i) each lift-up is associated with a disturbance which originates in the logarithmic region and is characterized by a mean motion towards the wall, and that (ii) such disturbances are generated by the interaction of an earlier burst from further upstream with the fluid motion in the logarithmic region.},

abstract = {To predict the energy yield from multiple turbines at close proximity, it is necessary to understand the structure and extent of the region of reduced velocity, the wake, that develops downstream of each turbine. Both large-scale turbulence and surface waves are known to occur at tidal stream sites so it is important to understand the influence of these processes on turbine wake recovery. An experimental study is presented of the influence of surface waves on both the ambient flow and wake recovery of a single horizontal axis tidal stream turbine. A wake is generated using a rotor of diameter D = 0.27m, which develops mean thrust coefficient and tip speed ratio of 0.9 and 5.5 respectively. Mean velocity is 0.46 m/s and turbulence characteristics are similar to full-scale.Waves of depth parameter (kd) 1 to 3.13 are considered representing full-scale waves of 10- 16 s over flow of 3.7 m/s in 31 m depth (approx.). Wake profiles immediately downstream of the rotor (2-4D) dif- fer considerably with wave depth parameter. Far wake recovery is analysed for two wave conditions with comparable wave energy flux. Intermediate waves lead to reduced deficit at and below the centreline up to 12D downstream. Deep waves reduce deficit in the upper half of wake only for part of the wake extent. The relationship between wake structure and flow characteristics is discussed.},

@article{Pans2013,
abstract = {Exploration of marine energy resources in coastal areas is often in conflict with other users in the increasingly congested coastal marine environment. Marine energy converters competes for space against other interests such as navigation, fisheries, recreation, environmental protection, aquaculture or other industry. These factors create a complex system within which the merit of renewable energy development has to be evaluated. The cost-benefit calculations for the development of marine energy needs to consider not only these factors, but also take into account local and international legislation, existing land and ocean space use on top of the CAPEX and OPEX. Assessing these often conflicting factors can be a complex and time consuming part of a project, but also one that can be phased efficiently from early feasibility throughout project development. DHI and ERI@N are presenting here a framework with a set of methodologies to ensure that competing spatial processes can be captured and assessed appropriately to ultimately allow the usage of the ocean space to be optimised. DHI has developed a set of tools for tidal and wave energy primarily, expandable to other ocean space utilisation. The tools are combined in the MIKE Customised platform for stakeholders to meet, exchange ideas and investigate options. It is serving as a database, but also allows visualisation of options, analysis of cumulative impacts and scenario management. The approach provides an overview of the available resources, while taking into account the limitations in space and through that provides a basis for an informed decision between developers, investors and regulators. In the same line of thought, DHI as member of SI Ocean works to quantify the size of the market opportunity in order to attract investors to the marine renewable market, to optimise the resource access and to make the overall process more transparent. An example of project development within these constraints is the development of a small scale tidal array in the highly congested waters of Singapore. The island Pulau Semakau is currently used as a testbed for wind power and smart-grid storage solutions. However, the mixed tidal stages around Semakau are suitable for small scale tidal energy converters. This project, currently in development, will demonstrate that with careful planning and analysis it is possible to establish an array even in Singapore's competitive marine space. Besides navigational issues, the array will be close to an aquaculture facility, to cooling water intakes and outfalls, and to one of the few publicly accessible coral reefs in Singapore. The online decision support tool has paved the way for this milestone project through presenting an integrated view of the highly detailed understanding of the driving local physical conditions, combined with high resolution spatial and temporal maps of the marine ecosystem, industrial receptors, and the all-important navigational requirements for shipping. One additional benefit of using this integrated approach is that it can be iterated endlessly as more information becomes available, and therefore the decision makers can track the progress of the resources throughout the project lifecycle from feasibility to energy forecast, along with the implications on environment and cost.},

Most devices currently under development are floating structures requiring some kind of station-keeping systems to operate, and so far the mooring system has been considered as a simple add-on component of the structure, and not as a structural element itself. The purpose of this paper is to provide further knowledge in the analysis of the mooring system for Wave Energy Converters, taking into account not only the mechanical behaviour of mooring system, but also providing an economic insight of the problem and achieving the purpose to optimize the energy absorption. Indeed, this paper presents the design and the techno-economic analysis of a mooring configuration for an axisymmetric heaving device. The design has been carried out by using a numerical model based on a quasi-static approach. The evaluation of the mooring system performance is based on existing normative and previous. The global cost, taking into account the main elements that constitute the system, has been estimated for several configurations of the mooring system, and the dependence of the costs on several variables analysed.},

The experiments are used to validate a fast and simple numerical method for the coupled time-domain analysis of floating wave energy converters in operational conditions. The numerical model uses hp-finite elements with a local discontinuous Galerkin formulation for the solution of the dynamics of the mooring cables and linear potential theory for the solution of the dynamics of the floating bodies. The results of the numerical model show an overall good agreement with experimental data. The dynamic behaviour of the tension at the fairlead is captured well, as well as the motions in in heave and pitch. In surge there are discrepancies.},

abstract = {An analysis tool for the study of wind speed profiles over the water has been developed. The profiles are analysed using amodified dimensionless wind speed and dimen- sionless height, assuming that the sea surface roughness can be predicted by Charnock's roughness length model. In this form, the roughness dependency on wind speed is extracted and the variations on the wind profile are due solely to atmospheric stability. The use of the Charnock's non-dimensional wind profile is illustrated using data collected from a meteoro- logical mast installed in the Danish North Sea. The best fit with the observed mean non- dimensional wind profile under neutral atmospheric conditions is found using a value of 1.2 × 10−2 for Charnock's parameter. The stability correction on the neutral wind profile suggested by the Businger-Dyer relations was found to perform well over the sea.},

These expressions are based on the logarithmic law of the wall and law of the wake formulation of Coles [J. Fluid Mech. 1, 19 1 (1956)] with the mean continuity and the mean momentum differential and integral equations. The concept of equilibrium layers of Clauser [Adv. Mech. 4, 1 (1956)] is extended and using similar ideas as Rotta [Prog. Aeronaut. Sci. 2, 1 ( 1962)] for self-similarity, a closure scheme is proposed for layers developing in arbitrary pressure gradients for the case where the streamwise derivative of the Coles wake factor is not too large. For a given flow case, this Coles wake condition can be tested with internal consistency checks. The mathematical framework is most suitable for incorporating Townsend's attached eddy hypothesis as recently developed by Perry, Li, and Mar{\&}6 [Philos. Trans. R. Sot. London Ser. A 336, 67 (1991)] for closure. This gives an opportunity to incorporate coherent structure concepts into closure schemes. Possible ways of handling the difficult case where the streamwise derivative of the Coles wake factor is significant are discussed.},

It is shown that the total mean wind power density is not particularly sensitive to the selection of roughness length or power law exponent; over the entire likely range of these parameters the wind power in the mean flow at typical aerogenerator hub heights is within 1.4-4 times the power at a reference height of about 10 m. In lieu of in situ profile measurements, it is suggested that a power law exponent of 1/7 is adequate for realistic but conservative estimates of the available wind power except at extremely rough sites where the estimates may only be conservative.},

abstract = {Five different particle image velocimetry (PIV) interrogation algorithms are tested with numerically generated particle images and two real data sets measured in turbulent flows with relatively small particle images of size 1.0–2.5 pixels. The size distribution of the particle images is analyzed for both the synthetic and the real data in order to evaluate the tendency for peak-locking occurrence. First, the accuracy of the algorithms in terms of mean bias and rms error is compared to simulated data. Then, the algorithms' ability to handle the peak-locking effect in an accelerating flow through a 2:1 contraction is compared, and their ability to estimate the rms and Reynolds shear stress profiles in a near-wall region of a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) at {\$}Re{\_}\backslashtau=510{\$} is analyzed. The results of the latter case are compared to direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of a TBL. The algorithms are: standard fast Fourier transform cross-correlation (FFT-CC), direct normalized cross-correlation (DNCC), iterative FFT-CC with discrete window shift (DWS), iterative FFT-CC with continuous window shift (CWS), and iterative FFT-CC CWS with image deformation (CWD). Gaussian three-point peak fitting for sub-pixel estimation is used in all the algorithms. According to the tests with the non-deformation algorithms, DNCC seems to give the best rms estimation by the wall, and the CWS methods give slightly smaller peak-locking observations than the other methods. With the CWS methods, a bias error compensation method for the bilinear image interpolation, based on the particle image size analysis, is developed and tested, giving the same performance as the image interpolation based on the cardinal function. With the CWD algorithms, the effect of the spatial filter size between the iteration loops is analyzed, and it is found to have a strong effect on the results. In the near-wall region, the turbulence intensity varies by up to 4$\backslash${\%}, depending on the chosen interrogation algorithm. In addition, the algorithms' computational performance is tested.},

abstract = {With a history of international failures, the survival envelope for wave energy convertors (WECs) has become an important consideration in the design of such systems. Potential design solutions require a better understanding of the hydrodynamics and structural loading experienced during extreme events, like rogue wave impact. This paper concerns the numerical modelling and experimental validation of extreme rogue wave interactions with a fixed truncated circular cylinder. Typical extreme waves from the intermediate depth Wave Hub site were produced at 1:30 scale in the COAST Lab Ocean basin at Plymouth University from the 100 year wave statistics using the dispersive focussing method, NewWave. A fixed 0.4m diameter cylinder with a 0.4m draft was used to represent the geometry of a generic point-absorber type WEC. Physical conditions were duplicated in a numerical wave tank, solving the fully nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations, with a free surface, using the volume of fluid (VoF) method and open source CFD library OpenFOAM{\textregistered}. The comparison between the results shows that the CFD software is capable of simulating extreme wave interactions with a fixed cylinder and the associated hydrodynamic phenomena very well.},

A single, isolated unit is optimised for performance and is used as a benchmark for comparison against each of the CETO units in the array.

abstract = { AbstractDifferent certification procedures in wind energy, such as power performance testing or load estimation, require measurements of the wind speed, which is set in relation to the electrical power output or the turbine loading. The wind shear affects the behavior of the turbine as hub heights and rotor diameters of modern wind turbines increase. Different measurement methods have been developed to take the wind shear into account. In this paper an approach is presented where the wind speed is measured from the nacelle of a wind turbine using a scanning lidar system.The measurement campaign was performed on the two-bladed Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART-2) at the National Wind Technology Center in Colorado. The wind speed of the turbine inflow was measured and recalculated in three different ways: using an anemometer installed on a meteorological mast, using the nacelle-based lidar scanner, and using the wind turbine itself. Here, the wind speed was recalculated from turbine data using the wind turbine as a big horizontal anemometer. Despite the small number of useful data, the correlation between this so-called rotor effective wind speed and the wind speed measured by the scanning nacelle-based lidar is high.It could be demonstrated that a nacelle-based scanning lidar system provides accurate measurements of the wind speed converted by a wind turbine. This is a first step, and it provides evidence to support further investigations using a much more extensive dataset and refines the parameters in the measurement process. },

@article{Richard2013,
abstract = {Acoustic Doppler sensors used for flow measurements at energetic tidal sites present an inherent Doppler noise in the measured signal, varying with hardware configuration and flow conditions. At scales comparable to the sensors' sampling frequencies, the corresponding perturbations notably contaminate the signal, and cannot be corrected in the time series. At such scales, dynamic phenomena are of particular interest in the process of increasing reliability and effectiveness of tidal turbines, and are mostly addressed in terms of statistics. In the case of inflow speed variations, the bias due to Doppler noise should be taken into account, and can be assessed via manufacturer specifications. Here, a method is presented that enables a direct estimation of the Doppler noise strength from the measured signal itself. Inspired from polynomial least square regression, it is based on a spectral analysis of the measured signal respect to turbulence theory, under the hypothesis of a white Doppler noise contamination. The subsequent limitations are discussed and illustrated by practical cases. The values found are generally higher than suggested by manufacturers, but still in the same order of magnitude. The use of the highest sampling frequency available is recommended. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The prediction of the aerodynamic performance of pitching airfoils in stall conditions is considered in the context of strong viscous-inviscid interaction modelling. The aim of the work is to demonstrate the capabilities of a low-cost dynamic stall model well suited for engineering applications. The model is formulated on the basis of a standard panel method combined with a vortex blob approximation of the wake. The development of the boundary layer over the airfoil and the evolution of the shear layer in the wake are taken into account by means of strong viscous-inviscid interaction coupling. To this end a transpiration layer is added to the inviscid formulation which represents the displacement effect viscosity results in the flow while the non-linear coupled equations are solved simultaneously. Separation is modelled by introducing a second wake originating from the separation point ('double-wake' concept) which is provided as part of the boundary layer solution. The theoretical presentation of the model is supported with favourable comparisons to four sets of wind tunnel measurements. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Regions that are favourable for tidal-stream energy extraction generally have high-velocities and low sediment accretion. However, it may be the case that energy extraction at these locations affects three important sediment transport processes: (1) fine and suspended sediment concentrations (turbidity maxima), (2) local sediment transport and the formation of sand banks, and (3) shelf-scale net sediment fluxes. Tidal energy extraction and sediment dynamics are simulated at a high-velocity location off the northwest coast of Anglesey, Wales (UK). This site generates some of the largest tidal velocities in the Irish Sea ({\textgreater} 2.5 m s-1, during spring tidal flow), due to high tidal amplitudes and flow being constricted by a collection of small rocky islands known as The Skerries. This site has been highlighted as one of seven specific regions of interest around the UK for ‘first generation' tidal energy extraction and has been leased by the Crown Estate for commercial development [1]. Tidal dissipation here generates a turbidity maximum; important as a source of secondary production and as a nursery area for marine species. Sand banks also form in the lee of headlands and islands and act as natural coastal protection. Flow around the northwest coast of Anglesey is asymmetrical in character and generates a net flux of coarse sediment into Liverpool Bay. In this paper, it is investigated whether energy extraction at the Skerries will impact these morphodynamic processes in a significant way, relative to seasonal or inter-annual variability.},

abstract = {Commercialization of wave energy will lead to the necessary deployment of Wave Energy Converters (WECs) in arrays, or wave farms. In order for projects in the United States to be approved, regulatory agencies must perform an Environmental Assessment proving little to no environmental impact. However, little is known about the environmental impacts of such wave farms. As a result, the environmental impacts of wave farms are largely determined by numerical wave models, however spectral wave models are currently limited in their ability to model WECs. Sandia National Laboratories is developing SNL-SWAN, a modified version of Simulation WAves Nearshore (SWAN) that includes a validated WEC Module to more realistically model the frequency and sea state dependent wave energy conversion of WECs.},

abstract = {Achieving accurate interpolation is an important requirement for many signal-processing applications. While nearest-neighbor and linear interpolation methods are popular due to their native GPU support, they unfortunately result in severe undesirable artifacts. Better interpolation methods are known but lack a native GPU support. Yet, a particularly attractive one is prefiltered cubic-spline interpolation. The signal it reconstructs from discrete samples has a much higher fidelity to the original data than what is achievable with nearest-neighbor and linear interpolation. At the same time, its computational load is moderate, provided a sequence of two operations is applied: first, prefilter the samples, and only then reconstruct the signal with the help of a B-spline basis. It has already been established in the literature that the reconstruction step can be implemented efficiently on a GPU. This article focuses on an efficient GPU implementation of the prefilter, on how to apply it to multidimensional samples (e.g. RGB color images), and on its performance aspects.},

Therefore, the variables of the model can be the specific discharge or the water level. The new model includes a wetting and drying scheme for predicting the moving boundary with a fixed mesh setup. In addition, bottom roughness is introduced either with a Manning coefficient or a normalised drag term. A zero equation model for shallow water flows accounts for the turbulent term. The new solver is validated with experimental and numerical test cases including one dam break test case, one channel flow and one coastal test case. Finally, a high resolution ocean modelling case is presented. The correct implementation of the boundary setup is introduced accounting for the tidal potential and the mesh setup is addressed. Results are compared to ADCP measurements including velocity and flow direction data (over time). An artificial blockage procedure is used to determine the theoretical power potential.},

The device includes a basin with horizontal cross-sectional area A0 that is connected to the sea by a channel of width B and length L, where the maximum water depth is H. The geometry of the device causes an oscillating fluid within the channel with the Helmholtz frequency of $\sigma$H 2=gHB/A0L while the strait's length L, as well as the basin's length scale A0 1/2, are much smaller than the incoming wave's wavelength. In this article, we examined the relation of above frequency to the device's geometry in both 1/25th and 1/7th scaled models at wave tank. Additionally, the sensitivity of the device in the 1/25th scale was explored where the angle of the winglets at entrance were varied to determine their effects in resonance. It was shown that the steepness of the angle of the winglets augments the higher orders of resonance in the device, thereby degrading the overall performance of the system. More over in the 1/7th scale the precision of the device to the angle between incoming waves and the device was probed through changing the device's axis, it was found that the axis changing have a negative effect in the wave amplitude at the basin and as a result on performance of the WEC.},

abstract = {Recent results have shown that flap-type wave energy converters are serious contenders in the challenge of harvesting energy from ocean water waves. In recent years, several analytical, numerical and experimental models have been made available to describe the behaviour of such converters in the open ocean and in an array. However, less interest has been paid in analysing the effects of the surrounding coastal environment on the performance of flap-type converters. This paper investigates the hydrodynamics of a flap-type wave energy converter near a straight coast line, modelled as an impermeable vertical cliff. Assuming the fluid inviscid and the flow irrotational, a potential flow theory is devised based on the application of Green's theorem in the fluid domain. This yields a hypersingular integral equation for the velocity potential which is solved via a series expansion in terms of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. It is shown that resonance phenomena arise which can either increase or decrease the capture factor of the converter, depending on the ratio between the distance of the converter from the coast and the wavelength of the incident wave field.},

abstract = {A so-called six-beam method is proposed to measure atmospheric turbulence using a ground-based wind lidar. This method requires measurement of the radial velocity variances at five equally spaced azimuth angles on the base of a scanning cone and one measurement at the centre of the scanning circle, i.e.using a vertical beam at the same height. The scanning configuration is optimized to minimize the sum of the random errors in the measurement of the second-order moments of the components (u,v, w) of the wind field. We present this method as an alternative to the so-called velocity azimuth display (VAD) method that is routinely used in commercial wind lidars, and which usually results in significant averaging effects of measured turbulence. In the VAD method, the high frequency radial velocity measurements are used instead of their variances. The measurements are performed using a pulsed lidar (WindScanner), and the derived turbulence statistics (using both methods) such as the u and v variances are compared with those obtained from a reference cup anemometer and a wind vane at 89 m height under different atmospheric stabilities. The measurements show that in comparison to the reference cup anemometer, depending on the atmospheric stability and the wind field component, the six-beam method measures between 85 and 101{\%} of the reference turbulence, whereas the VAD method measures between 66 and 87{\%} of the reference turbulence.},

A comparison with estimates based on three different wave model data sources (produced from the WAM, Wave Watch III and SWAN wind-wave models) and buoy measurement data in the nearshore region of the French marine energy test site SEM-REV is made.

abstract = {Image processing methods for particle image velocimetry (PIV) are reviewed. The discussion focuses on iterative methods aimed at enhancing the precision and spatial resolution of numerical interrogation schemes. Emphasis is placed on the efforts made to overcome the limitations of the correlation interrogation method with respect to typical problems such as in-plane loss of pairs, velocity gradient compensation and correlation peak locking. The discussion shows how the correlation signal benefits from simple operations such as the window-offset technique, or the continuous window deformation, which compensates for the in-plane velocity gradient. The image interrogation process is presented within the discussion of the image matching problem and several algorithms and implementations currently in use are classified depending on the choice made about the particle image pattern matching scheme. Several methods that differ in their implementations are found to be substantially similar. Iterative image deformation methods that account for the continuous particle image pattern transformation are analysed and the effect of crucial choices such as image interpolation method, displacement prediction correction and correlation peak fit scheme are discussed. The quantitative performance assessment made through synthetic PIV images yields order-of-magnitude improvement on the precision of the particle image displacement at a sub-pixel level when the image deformation is applied. Moreover, the issue of spatial resolution is addressed and the limiting factors of the specific interrogation methods are discussed. Finally, an attempt for a flow-adaptive spatial resolution method is proposed. The method takes into account the local velocity derivatives in order to perform a local increase of the interrogation spatial density and a refinement of the local interrogation window size. The resulting spatial resolution is selectively enhanced. The methods performance is analysed and compared with some precursor techniques, namely the conventional cross-correlation analysis with and without the effect of a window discrete offset and deformation. The suitability of the method for the measurement in turbulent flows is illustrated with the application to a turbulent backward facing step flow},

abstract = {The present study proposes a super-resolution approach for the analysis of particle image velocimetry (PIV) recordings. The method is based on image correlation with respect to the second spatial derivatives of the particle image displacement distribution. The direct measurement of the displacement second derivatives (spatial curvature) is obtained by maximizing the product of deformed particle image patterns. The paper describes the performance of the cross-correlation approach in terms of spatial resolution in analogy with linear filters (moving average) as directly applied to the displacement distribution over the interrogation window. The proposed method aims at reducing the evaluation error and introduces a correlation scheme, which directly measures the local second derivatives of the displacement distribution over the interrogation window. The window product is maximized separately for each spatial derivative term in order to reduce the large computational cost associated with image deformation resampling and image product. The method's performance is assessed first by evaluating the modulation transfer function using synthetic PIV images with a one-dimensional sinusoidal displacement, where results show a factor of three spatial resolution enhancement. The extension to the two-dimensional case is obtained by simulation of homogeneous random fluctuations. The measurement uncertainty is kept at the same level as that of the window deformation iterative and multi-grid method (WIDIM). The assessment of the method's performances in actual experimental conditions is made by analysing a wall jet flow, focusing the attention on the steep velocity profile across the free shear layer. The assessment compares the velocity and vorticity profiles obtained by varying the size of the interrogation window. The factor of three improvement of the spatial resolution is also confirmed for the experimental case. However, a slight increase of the measurement uncertainty is observed.},

Time resolved measurements are performed at Re = 180, 360 and 540, whereas the transitional (Re = 1,080) and turbulent regimes (Re = 5,540) are investigated by snapshots separated in phase by more than $\pi$/4. The vortex structure evolution is visualized by the 3D vorticity field, revealing a regular shedding at the lowest Reynolds, whereas at Re {\textgreater} 500 the B{\'{e}}nard-K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street exhibits counter-rotating stream-wise vortex pairs (characteristic of Mode B) dominating the 3D motion. The regime at Re = 360 produces a transitional pattern where the counter-rotating vortex pairs (Mode B), coexist with profoundly distorted shedding of oblique elements forming a chain of rhombus-like vortex cells. In the turbulent flow regime (Re = 5,540) a large increase in the range of flow scales is directly observed with the appearance of Kelvin-Helmholtz type vortices in the separated shear layer consistently with what is abundantly reported in literature. The statistical description of the secondary structures is inferred from a 3D autocorrelation analysis yielding two span-wise wavelengths for the counter-rotating pairs, an inner length given by (twice) the distance between counter-rotating elements and an outer one given by the distance between pairs. The uncertainty analysis of the present tomographic PIV experiments reveals that this approach is suited for the investigation of vortex wakes with a typical error of 2 and 10{\%} on the velocity and vorticity vectors, respectively.},

abstract = {Statistics obtained from seven different direct numerical simulations (DNSs) pertaining to a canonical turbulent boundary layer (TBL) under zero pressure gradient are compiled and compared. The considered data sets include a recent DNS of a TBL with the extended range of Reynolds numbers Re$\theta$ = 500–4300. Although all the simulations relate to the same physical flow case, the approaches differ in the applied numerical method, grid resolution and distribution, inflow generation method, boundary conditions and box dimensions. The resulting comparison shows surprisingly large differences not only in both basic integral quantities such as the friction coefficient cf or the shape factor H12, but also in their predictions of mean and fluctuation profiles far into the sublayer. It is thus shown that the numerical simulation of TBLs is, mainly due to the spatial development of the flow, very sensitive to, e.g. proper inflow condition, sufficient settling length and appropriate box dimensions. Thus, a DNS has to be considered as a numerical experiment and should be the subject of the same scrutiny as experimental data. However, if a DNS is set up with the necessary care, it can provide a faithful tool to predict even such notoriously difficult flow cases with great accuracy.},

abstract = {The performance enhancing effects of closely pack- ing tidal turbines in arrays are evaluated in this computational study. Various lateral spacings ranging from 0.25d to 4d (d is the rotor diameter), as well as a virtually unblocked case, are examined. Infinite turbine fences are simulated through the use of periodic boundary conditions. A blade element momentum method embedded in a three- dimensional Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes solver (RANS- BEM) is applied to determine a hydrodynamically optimal rotor design for each lateral spacing, thus taking into account the effect of local blockage on rotor optimisation. Increased blockage is found to result in increased optimal rotor solidity and decreased optimal blade pitch. A matrix of array simulations is then completed with each rotor design tested for its design spacing as well as several off- design lateral spacings. The resulting power coefficient is found to be largest when the rotor optimised for the highest blockage case is used in the array with the closest lateral spacing. Further, even though a rotor's performance may be increased through operation at a blockage higher than its design point, it still exhibits inferior performance relative to a rotor designed for that higher blockage setting. The results indicate that the local blockage must be considered in the rotor design process if the optimal rotor efficiency for a given spacing is to be achieved.},

abstract = {Abstract{\~{}}{\~{}}The stability and resolution of iterative PIV image analysis methods is investigated. The study focuses on the effects of stabilization by means of spatial filtering when implemented into the iterative process. Two filtering approaches are studied: predictor and corrector filtering respectively. A family of convolution filters is proposed, which allows to vary the filtering strength in a systematic way and primarily affects the system stability and to a smaller extent its spatial response. A critical value for the filter parameter is identified which guarantees the stability of the iterative process. A theoretical analysis is provided that determines the asymptotic properties of the iterative method with varying filter parameters. The study is completed with a numerical assessment and concludes with an application to real experiments, showing the consequence of an incorrect implementation of the iterative scheme under experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Coherent structures and their time evolution in the logarithmic region of a turbulent boundary layer investigated by means of 3D space–time correlations and time-dependent conditional averaging techniques are the focuses of the present paper. Experiments have been performed in the water tunnel at TU Delft measuring the particle motion within a volume of a turbulent boundary layer flow along a flat plate at a free-stream velocity of 0.53 m/s at Re $\theta$ = 2,460 based on momentum thickness by using time-resolved tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) at 1 kHz sampling rate and particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). The obtained data enable an investigation into the flow structures in a 3D Eulerian reference frame within time durations corresponding to 28 $\delta$/U. An analysis of the time evolution of conditional averages of vorticity components representing inclined hairpin-like legs and of Q2- and Q4-events has been performed, which gives evidence to rethink the early stages of the classical hairpin development model for high Reynolds number TBLs. Furthermore, a PTV algorithm has been applied on the time sequences of reconstructed 3D particle image distributions identifying thousands of particle trajectories that enable the calculation of probability distributions of the three components of Lagrangian accelerations.},

abstract = {The formation and development of a turbulent spot in a laminar boundary layer flow is governed by the self-organization of generic substructures like hairpin-like vortices and spanwise alternating wall bounded low- and high-speed streaks which effectively produce new turbulent flow structures out of the oncoming laminar flow reaching the spot at the rear edge. Although the main substructures of a spot are identified and the exchange topologies in wall normal directions inside the spot are depicted roughly by means of dual plane stereo PIV (Schr{\"{o}}der and Kompenhans 2004) the principle growth mechanism of the turbulent spot itself is still not fully understood. The analysis of this growth process would also help to understand the function of very similar structures for the turbulent exchange in fully developed turbulent boundary layer flows. In this feasibility study the tomographic PIV technique (Elsinga et al. 2005) has been applied to time resolved PIV recordings. Four high speed CMOS cameras are imaging tracer particles which were illuminated in a volume inside a boundary layer flow at 5 kHz by using two high repetitive Nd:YAG pulse lasers. The instantaneously acquired single particle images of these cameras have been used for a three dimensional tomographic reconstruction of the light intensity distribution of the particle images in a volume of voxels (volume elements) virtually representing the measurement volume. Each of two subsequently acquired and reconstructed particle image distributions are cross-correlated in small interrogation volumes using iterative multi-grid schemes with volume-deformation in order to determine a time series of instantaneous 3D-3C velocity vector fields. The measurement volume with a size of {\~{}} 34 x 19 x 30 mm³ was located near the wall in a flat plate boundary layer flow with zero pressure gradients and downstream of a local disturbance source. At a free stream velocity of U = 7 m/s a turbulent spot grows downstream inside a laminar flat plate boundary layer flow after introducing a short initial flow injection and convects through the measurement volume. The time resolved tomographic PIV method enables capturing the spatio-temporal development of the complete flow structures and in particular the rapid formation process of hairpin-like vortices at the trailing-edge of the spot. In comparison an experiment with a wire-tripped flat plate turbulent boundary layer flow has been performed in order to reveal the differences of both flow types. The measurement method offers the possibility to determine the complete time dependent three-dimensional velocity gradient- tensor within the measurement volume. The 3D vorticity operator has been applied to the dataset in order to identify the three dimensional development of the vortical structures inside the turbulent spot, which enables the analysis of the role of coherent structures for flow exchange mechanisms in such wall bounded turbulent flows.},

abstract = {Offshore floating wind turbines (OFWTs) present unique aerodynamic analysis challenges. Motion-derived velocity perturbations in the wake necessitate higher-fidelity aerodynamic analysis methods than the ubiquitous momentum balance techniques currently in use. A more physically-sound approach is to model the wake generated by a wind turbine rotor as a freely convecting lattice, using the resultant inflow to estimate rotor loads, as it done with a free vortex wake method (FVM). The FVM code Wake Induced Dynamics Simulator (WInDS) was developed at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst to predict the aerodynamic loading and wake evolution of an OFWT to a higher degree of accuracy than is possible via momentum balance methods. A series of validation cases were conducted to provide some basis for applying WInDS to floating wind turbine cases, for which no aerodynamic experimental data is currently available. The results from these tests show that WInDS is able to accurately predict the aerodynamically-derived loads and wake structures generated by various fixed and rotary-wing cases, and may therefore be applied to more complex cases, like OFWTs, with a degree of confidence. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper explores the loss mechanisms critical to the operation of a tidal stream turbine. This is motivated by the fact that there is an upper limit to the amount of power that may be removed from a tidal stream by a turbine. To generate the maximum electricity possible, the designer may therefore aim to minimise the ratio of loss to useful power. Computational predictions were undertaken on a horizontal axis tidal turbine in a channel with a blockage ratio of 0.07. At design point, the total loss for this case was 69.2{\%} of the useful power extracted, Pshaft. This may be broken down to different sources: rotor profile loss, structural loss, and wake mixing loss. Wake mixing loss is shown to dominate with a value of 58.1{\%} Pshaft. The composition of the wake mixing loss is then investigated. It is shown that in addition to the ‘idealised' radial variation of velocity through the wake there was also significant circumferential variation. This circumferential variation is responsible for approximately two thirds of total wake mixing loss, while the remaining one third is due to radial variations. This result implies that wake mixing loss could be reduced by designing turbines which produce wakes with lower circumferential non-uniformity.},

In the model, the effect of tidal arrays is represented by line discontinuities where upstream and downstream heads are related by Linear Momentum Actuator Disk Theory. A parametric study to investigate the importance of array locations, the connectivity of the arrays and local blockage effects on the available power has been undertaken. General conclusions from this analysis are that it is usually advantageous to arrange tidal turbines in long rows rather than as a number of rows in series, and that arrays with higher local blockage outperform arrays with lower blockage. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {When the turbine extracts power from the wind, a wake evolves downstream of the turbine. The turbines operating in the wake are not only subjected to a decreased wind speed but also increased dynamic loading arising from the increased turbulence induced by the upstream turbines. This increased turbulence must be accounted, when selecting a turbine. This increase in turbulence intensity can imply a significant reduction in the fatigue lifetime of wind turbines placed in wakes. For this reason, a large number of studies have been established concerning the calculation of wake added turbulence. Even though a number of mathematical functions have been proposed for modeling the wake added turbulence, there are still disadvantages of the models like very demanding in terms of calculation time. Artificial neural networks (ANN) can be used as alternative to analytical approach as ANN offers advantages such as no required knowledge of internal system parameters, compact solution for multi-variable problems and fast calculation. In this investigation adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), which is a specific type of the ANN family, was used to predict the wake added turbulence. Neural network in ANFIS adjusts parameters of membership function in the fuzzy logic of the fuzzy inference system (FIS). This intelligent algorithm is implemented using Matlab/Simulink and the performances are investigated. The simulation results presented in this paper show the effectiveness of the developed method.},

abstract = {It is expected that ultimately, like offshore wind farms, electrical systems will make up to a quarter of the overall Capex of wave farms. This is a significant element of cost and consideration must be taken in the design of both individual wave energy converters (WECs) and arrays of WECs to ensure that these costs can be minimised. In a worst case scenario design decisions could increase the cost of the electrical system by several orders and ultimately make the technology uncompetitive. This paper outlines the impacts on the cost of the electrical system arising from design factors of WECs and WEC arrays or wave farms. The paper uses a cost model to examine the impact to the cost of WEC array electrical systems caused by changing of key design factors. The design factors examined include WEC unit rating, capacity factor, interface to the electrical network, array spacing, export voltage, array design, site selection, export distance, and WEC dynamic response. All of these design factors have an impact on the economics of the electrical system and hence the economics of the wave farm as a whole. The paper concludes that there are some critical design choices which should be avoided if a cost-effective wave farm is to be established. It is also concluded that some design choices could ultimately reduce the overall Capex of WEC arrays enhancing their competiveness.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for combining device-scale and basin-scale simulation methods to provide realistic in-situ performance analysis of turbine arrays and with the eventual goal of determining basin-scale effects from large turbine arrays. The present state-of-the-art basin-scale simulation methods represent turbines as sub-grid-scale objects, typically using semi-empirical/semi-analytical turbine models. Device-scale CFD simulation methods can resolve flows around turbines and can predict turbine performance outside the idealized assumptions of analytical methods. Thus, combining the capabilities of these two types of simulations is desirable for accurate in-situ performance analysis with the correct influence of turbines on the basin flow. The approach is to parameterize turbine thrust and power using a reference velocity available to both types of model. This is a volume average over a region in space that can be resolved by the basin-scale model. The approach is accurate provided both methods predict a consistent reference velocity. This paper presents preliminary studies testing such consistency for simplified channel scenarios, finding that as long as the averaging volume has length scales twice the turbine diameter, relative error in power is typically under 5{\%}. When applied to a complex real-world flow, the relative error was larger. It is thought that at present, the method is suitable for approximate power prediction and further improvement is required for accurate turbine performance studies.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate experimentally rotation and turbulence effects on a wind turbine blade aerodynamics, focusing particularly on stall mechanisms. The wind tunnel tests consisted in surface pressure measurements on a horizontal axis wind turbine airfoil subjected to freestream turbulence levels varying from 4.5{\%} to 12{\%}. A method to determine the position of the separation point on the rotating blade, based on the chordwise pressure gradient in the separated area, is proposed. The results showed an influence of the freestream turbulence level on the separation point position. Experimental results in the literature showed lift augmentation for a rotating blade. In our case, the study of the separation point position coupled with the pressure distributions on the airfoil shows that this lift augmentation seems related to a lower value of the pressure in the separated area rather than to a stall delay phenomenon. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A cycloidal wave energy converter (CycWEC) is a novel wave energy converter design which uses lift based hydrofoils as a means of interacting with ocean waves, as well as feedback control to terminate the incoming wave. The hydrofoils are attached at a distance to the main shaft, and the device converts wave energy to shaft power directly by rotating in sync with the incoming wave. The particular double cycloidal wave energy converter configuration investigated here consists of two of these devices arranged symmetrically on a common shaft. Since the generator and both devices are attached to the ocean floor by means of a central monopile, there is a gap between the left and right device to allow attachment of the double wave energy converter assembly to the ocean floor. In this publication we investigated the impact of the gap between left and right device, as well as overall device span on the three dimensional radiation efficiency. This was done using a numerical 3D radiation simulation code that was validated in earlier work against experimental data from 1:10 scale wave tank tests. For small blade spans the gap was found to cause an increase in wave energy converter efficiency, while for very large spans the efficiency decreased with gap size. Inspection of the radiation patterns yielded an understanding of the flow physics responsible for the efficiency changes.},

Improvements on the design methods are increasingly needed. The purpose of this research is to investigate the use of the Loewy´s lift deficiency function (LDF), also named Returning Wake Model, coupled with a non-stationary Blade Element-Momentum Method (BEM). The LDF simulates the influence of the wake behind the wind turbine on its capacity to generate power. It is expected that this model reduce the dependency of the several empirical parameters necessary in other wake models which are currently used. Aiming to validate the results obtained in this new approach they are compared with those provided by commercial computational software and they have proven to be very consistent. It is concluded that the method is feasible to be used as an efficient design and optimization tool of upwind horizontal axis wind turbine blad},

abstract = {It has been shown that turbulent flows are greatly affected by streamline curvature. In spite of this and the fact that curved shear flows are frequently encountered in engineering applications, the predictions of such flows are relatively less developed than the predictions of two-dimensional plane flows. Recently, various attempts were made by different investigators; however, their methods are only successful when the product of the boundary layer thickness to the local surface curvature is approximately 0.05. The present paper investigates the more general case where this product is in the range from 0.1 to 0.5. Results show that the calculated boundary-layer characteristics for arbitrary free stream conditions are in good agreement with measurements.},

abstract = {Wave Dragon is an overtopping type offshore wave energy converter. The paper deals with phase 1 of a full-scale 1.5 MW demonstrator project at the test centre DanWEC, Hanstholm. Wave Dragons will be produced in four sizes, optimized for 1.5 to 12 MW of capacity. The economic optimal size depends on the wave climate at the deployment site. Expected deployment sites will typically be at water depths above 30 m to exploit high power wave resources The development of a 1.5 MW Wave Dragon demonstrator is based on experiences from 20,000 test hours with a smaller prototype. The 3 times up-scaled demonstrator device will be a reinforced concrete construction with a design lifetime of 50 years. It weighs around 6,500 tons and is equipped with 8 hydro-turbine generators, each delivering a power of 185 kW. The paper covers part of the development of the certified 1.5 MW WD design where new laboratory tests on a scale 1:50 model has been performed in order to establish missing data for a correlation between the computer software codes used in design; the results from the real sea testing; and the model scale testing. The focus is on the mooring forces and the design loads on the device platform and wings.},

Both the spatial variations of the turbulence and the shadows behind the wind turbine towers are included in the model for rotational sampling. The model is verified using measured wind speeds and power fluctuations from wind turbines.},

abstract = {This paper synthesizes the technical feasibility study carried out for a hybrid ocean energy converter. The solution envisaged involves a 100m large semi-submersible platform designed with five columns and equipped with floating pitching Wave Energy Converters (WECs). This floating structure is mounted with a 5MW wind turbine. The present study covers power performance estimations and structural analysis. The first section describes the “Wave to Wire” model programmed in both frequency and time domain. The mathematical and hydrodynamic assumptions are highlighted together with the numerical model. The second part starts with the assessment of the performances of this device, carried out using in-house simulation codes. Based on combined wave and wind resources, the annual average absorbed power figures are compared with published results for existing ocean energy converters. The total rated power of the combined system reaches 10MW. Eventually, the last section approaches practical topics, directly related to the capital and operational costs inherent to an industrial development phase. The total steel mass of the semi-submersible is estimated first, from structural calculations carried out for a selection of 3D static loads cases. Then, the extreme loads from the WECs are taken into account for a second design phase.},

Here, we present results obtained using the dynamic penetrometer Nimrod for rapid geotechnical characterization of the seafloor surface, and median grain sizes determined from grab samples. Sediment probing was complemented by sequential bathymetric surveying using multibeam sonar. The latter revealed a complex bathymetry including dune fields corresponding to a strong variability of sediments (gravel to fine sand, and shell hash) and geotechnical appearance of the seafloor surface. The Nimrod profiles ranged from very hard impacts, over a soft top layer of 2–7cm thickness above a stiffer substratum, to sites of poor consolidation in the upper decimeter of the seafloor surface. Comparison with multibeam images allowed identification of ongoing sediment remobilization processes. Additionally, this data set was used to assess the WASSP R ? system's capability of estimating surficial seafloor hardness by comparison to the Nimrod results. Overall, the results of our investigations to date suggest ongoing processes of sediment remobilization, which potentially impact on the in- stream tidal power development in this passage.},

abstract = {Project WESA (Wave Energy for a Sustainable Archipelago) is an international scientific research project aimed at developing and investigating the performance of a wave energy converter system designed for operation in an archipelago environment with ice interference during winter conditions. Project WESA is also a cross-border collaboration effort, and part of the EU funded Central Baltic INTERREG IV A programme1, with an additional objective to raise awareness of wave power as a potential renewable energy source for the Central Baltic region. The paper introduces the wave power test site at Hammarudda, developed by project WESA, which is situated approx. 15 km west of the city Mariehamn on the island of {\AA}land in the Baltic Sea. The paper describes the wave energy converter (WEC) system, the measuring station, the installed measurement and surveillance systems, the communication and control system, a bit about how the experiments were conducted and in particular the theories behind the buoy designs and the experimental buoys used for operation in ice. The paper also discusses other aspects important for development of wave power plants in the Baltic Sea, such as environmental aspects and the potential for utilization. The paper presents results from power generation in no-ice conditions, force measurements, and camera surveillance during operation in two different seasons of icy winter conditions. The experiments show that the WEC and buoy system can handle iceinteraction of the kind encountered at the test site during the winter seasons of 2011/2012 and 2012/2013, which corresponds to withstanding drifting ice fields of varying thicknesses and shape, and ice with a thermodynamically generated thickness of up to 15 cm, without encountering problems.},

Developers are reaching the stage of prototype deployments but there are still a number of issues (survivability, operations {\&} maintenance (O{\&}M), device efficiency etc.) to be overcome before a commercial scale wave energy park is feasible. The EU FP7 MARINA Platform project has assessed the potential for larger devices with multiple PTO systems on one structure in an attempt to address survivability while maximising the energy extraction potential for the device. The other main area of interest has been cost effective PTO systems with minimal of critical components to ensure reliable performance in harsh environments. This paper describes the development process of a floating reinforced concrete oscillating water column (OWC) array wave energy converter (WEC), named Delta-E, for deployment in offshore environments.},

abstract = {The treatment of inlet conditions for LES is a complex problem, but of extreme importance as, in many cases, the fluid behaviour within the domain is determined in large part by the inlet behaviour. The reason why it is so difficult to formulate inlet conditions is because the inlet flow must include a stochastically-varying component: ideally this component should ‘look' like turbulence whilst at the same time be as simple as possible to implement and modify. We review methods for accomplishing this reported in the literature, these being ‘precursor simulation' methods and ‘synthesis' methods, and implement our own novel versions of these using the code OpenFOAM. Conclusions have been drawn about the relative merits of the different approaches, based on the physical realism of the results and the ease of construction and use.},

abstract = {A detailed experimental study has been completed to characterise the near-wake of a model three-bladed Horizontal Axis Tidal Stream Turbine (diameter = 0:5m). The turbine was tested at the University of Liverpool high-speed water channel. A non-uniform “flow-profiler” has been developed, using a series of 16mm horizontal bars, to produce a 1=5th power-law vertical velocity profile in the channel. The integral average upstream velocity, over the turbine swept area, was set to 0:82m=s and had an average turbulence intensity of approximately 5{\%}. Power and thrust measurements from the turbine are compared to results in uniform flow. When plotted non-dimensionally, using the integral average velocity, the power and thrust for both the uniform and non-uniform flow are seen to be the same. To provide details of the flow emerging from the turbine, measurements of the nearwake have been taken using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. These were taken up to five diameters downstream of the turbine over a series of spanwise profiles at various depths to fully map the near-wake flow field. The flow characteristics of the nearwake downstream of the turbine in non-uniform flow is similar to previous results with uniform flow. It is shown that in both flow conditions the swirl from the rotation of the turbine is very prominent and is still significant at 5 diameters downstream.},

abstract = {The reliability of marine renewable energy (MRE) converters is a key issue that has to be addressed and included in a whole system approach, in order to make the energy extraction from these sources a viable option. At the current development stage of MRE converters, an increasing number of devices are being field tested at pre-commercial demonstration scale, yielding field experience and load data useful for refining, demonstrating and improving the reliability of devices. This paper gives a brief review of the most advanced technologies and common reliability aspects that provide the rationale for dedicated component testing. It describes a service simulation test approach and the development of a unique large-scale component test facility. The test rig is capable of replicating the forces and motions experienced by components for a range of floating marine applications. The replication of motion angles is demonstrated in this paper. The service simulation test of a marine power cable is presented as a case study on how component performance can be assessed and demonstrated prior to long-term field deployments in order to ensure the reliability of crucial sub-systems and components in the harsh marine environment.},

Of particular interest is the robustness of the “turbulent intensity,” defined as the ratio of velocity standard deviation to velocity mean. Simultaneously, the quality of raw ping Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data for turbulence studies is evaluated against Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) data at a point. Removal of Doppler noise from the raw ping data is shown to be a crucial step in turbulence quantification. Excluding periods of slack tide, the corrected turbulent intensity estimates at a height of 4.6 m above the seabed are 10{\%} and 11{\%} from the ADCP and ADV, respectively. Estimates of the turbulent dissipation rate are more variable, from 10−3 to 10−1 W/m3. An example analysis of coherent Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) is presented.},

abstract = {Turbulence is known to affect the performance and surviv- ability of tidal turbines, yet characterization of turbulence in the field remains limited. Here, we refine and demonstrate a new approach to turbulence measurements, in which an array of mul- tiple Acoustic Doppler Velocimeters (ADV) is suspended above the seabed at the hub height of a tidal turbine. These measure- ments provide information on the intensity, structure, and coher- ence of turbulence across the scale of a turbine rotor ({\textless} 10 m). Deployment of multiple moorings expands the analysis to array scales ({\textgreater} 10 m). Motion correction of the moored ADV data is essential to this approach and is verified using the turbulent ki- netic energy spectra. Additional measurements include a bottom- mounted 5-beam Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler, from which scales can be assessed using the velocities a separation distances along a given beam. These methods are demonstrated with data collected at the site of the Snohomish PUD pilot project in Ad- miralty Inlet, Puget Sound, WA (USA), where two OpenHydro turbines are planned for deployment. Coherent motion is found to be largely isotropic, such that coherence is high only at scales less than the advective length scale or the water depth, whichever is less.},

Time series data from multiple acoustic Doppler instruments are analyzed to obtain statistical measures of fluctuations in both the magnitude and direction of the tidal currents. The resulting turbulence intensities (i.e., the turbulent velocity fluctuations normalized by the deterministic tidal currents) are typically 10{\%} at the hub heights (i.e., the relevant depth) of the proposed turbines. Length and time scales of the turbulence are also analyzed. Large-scale, anisotropic eddies dominate the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) spectra, which may be the result of proximity to headlands at each site. At small scales, an isotropic turbulent cascade is observed and used to estimate the dissipation rate of TKE, which is shown to balance with shear production. Data quality and sampling parameters are discussed, with an emphasis on the removal of Doppler noise from turbulence statistics. The results are relevant to estimating the performance and fatigue of tidal turbines.},

One is situated in the southern part of Achill Island on the Co. Mayo coastline, whereas the second is centered at Killard point on the Co. Clare coast. The wave climate is estimated using the third generation spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III, forced with directional wave spectral data and 10m winds obtained from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) archive. The local area models are validated with wave buoy and Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data for intermediate to shallow depths (50m or less) obtained from the ESB's WestWave project. Our results show that for an accurate representation of the directionality in the nearshore, in particular for steep bathymetric slopes found at the cliffs and exposed rocky shores of the Irish coastline, reflection needs to be accounted for. It has been found that reflection affects mainly the directional spread of the resource and to a lesser degree the significant wave height.},

abstract = {The maximum average power that can be captured from ocean waves by an idealised and unconstrained oscillating body depends on two hydrodynamic properties: the wave radiation pattern and the radiation resistance (also called added damping or wave damping coefficient). These properties depend on the body geometry and the mode of oscillation. For such unconstrained motion the limits of absorbed power are well described. Power bounds due to physical restrictions like limited volume stroke or machinery stroke length has also received some attention, but has not been sufficiently explored. This paper looks at such physical bounds to the achievable absorbed power. It is done by physical reasoning leading to analytical expressions for the upper bounds, treating heave, surge and pitch motions separately. It is shown how size, oscillation mode and volume stroke of the oscillating body inherently influence the absorption ability. Furthermore, implications for the practical and economical design of wave energy are identified and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Bimep has identified the need to promote high standards of safety to protect the marine environment and nearby navigational routes in addition to bimep's infrastructure, developers or subcontractors operating on the site, and the device assets themselves. This paper presents a methodology based on a set of high level technical requirements to be considered by MRED developers prior to being granted acceptance to deploy their equipment within the facility. The resulting safety considerations for the deployment of MREDs at bimep are then applied to one particular case study, the Oceantec Wave Energy Converter. The risk assessment philosophy provides some important benefits for MRED developers, namely enhanced device design and construction, better operational and contingency plans, improved communication with bimep (particularly when changes affect safety), and clearer distribution of responsibilities.},

Float response and modification of the wave field are measured to provide data suitable for the evaluation of array interaction models and environmental scale models. Each wave energy converter unit has a diameter of 0.315 m and power absorption is due to friction of both a power take off system and bearings. Response is measured on all floats and surge force on five floats. Wave gauges are located withinand around the array. Wave conditions studied include regular waves and both long- and short-crested irregular waves. A rectilinear arrangement of support structures is employed such that several float configurations can be studied. A summary is presented of the experimental arrangement with particular emphasis on the individual wave energy converters and wave conditions employed. Reasonable agreement is observed between measured response for single floats and power output and float response predicted using a linear time domain model. For an array of 25 floats, up to 16.3{\%} reduction of significant wave height is observed down-wave and 10.8{\%} increase observed upwave for unidirectional irregular waves due to wave radiation by the heaving WECs. Spectra at different locations within and around the array show the wave field modifications.},

@article{Tsao2002,
abstract = {A viscous-inviscid interaction triple-deck structure is developed to describe the thermomechanical interaction of an air boundary layer with ice sheets and liquid films. Linear stability results are compared with nonlinear triple-deck computations, and a number of nonlinear simulations of air-water-ice interactions are presented. An icing instability is encountered in regimes with simultaneous wall and air cooling that is believed to admit small scale and highly irregular surface roughness. The stabilization of the smallest scale icing disturbances is obtained through the Gibbs Thomson relation. This local thermodynamic condition relates the freezing temperature of a pure substance to the surface tension and the mean curvature of the interface and provides a short scale stabilizing mechanism for icing instability modes. Comparison with available experimental data on glaze ice roughness diameters, accreted on NACA 0012 airfoil leading edges under glaze icing conditions, is provided. It is also found in all cases computed in this study that water beads can be formed on a wetted ice surface once the water film is locally ruptured by ice roughness elements. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@book{impactofturbulencebook,
abstract = {This book presents the results of the seminar “Wind Energy and the Impact of Turbulence on the Conversion Process” which was supported from three societies, namely the EUROMech, EAWE and ERCOFATC and took place in Oldenburg, Germany in spring 2012.The seminar was one of the first scientific meetings devoted to the common topic of wind energy and basic turbulence. The established community of researchers working on the challenging puzzle of turbulence for decades met the quite young community of researchers, who face the upcoming challenges in the fast growing field of wind energy applications.From the fluid mechanical point of view, wind turbines are large machines operating in the fully turbulent atmospheric boundary layer. In particular they are facing small-scale turbulent inflow conditions. It is one of the central puzzles in basic turbulence research to achieve a fundamental understanding of the peculiarities of small-scale turbulence. This book helps to better understand the resulting aerodynamics around the wind turbine's blades and the forces transmitted into the machinery in this context of puzzling inflow conditions. This is a big challenge due to the multi-scale properties of the incoming wind field ranging from local flow conditions on the profile up to the interaction of wake flows in wind farms.},

abstract = {In order to deliver cost competitive solutions, Wave Energy Converters (WEC) must be optimized in several fields, e.g. transportation, installation, structure, machinery etc. Large expenses lie on the superstructure support, i.e. the offshore foundation. Geotechnical analysis and optimization of six possible foundation solutions for WEC are presented in this article. The study is performed for WEC superstructure supported by two or four foundations. In the four-column system horizontal wind and wave loads are transformed as a pair of vertical forces, acting in tension and compression. When the overturning moment is large, it might be desirable to increase the width distance, achieving smaller vertical forces. For this reason, several distances between the supporting columns are investigated. Additionally, a two-column system is analysed as it is expected to be more cost effective. In such a solution horizontal wind and wave loads are dominant. Gravity based, pile and bucket foundations are universally applied solutions for the offshore structures. The suitability of these types for a WEC is analysed and commented. The foundations are designed to satisfy ultimate and serviceability limit state requirements. For each of the foundation solutions, three geotechnical design steps are followed, employing analytical calculations, numerical 2D and 3D finite element programs.},

@article{Vantoch-Wood2013,
abstract = {The potential future benefits of having a strong marine renewable energy1 (MRE) sector within a country or region are both well recognised and well documented (Kablan et al., 2012; Vantoch-Wood et al., 2012; PMSS, 2010). Several basic requirements are needed to commercialise MRE in coastal regions: • adequate primary resource within an economic distance from the shore; • accessible and available harbour facilities; • a practicable onshore high voltage connection (with available capacity); • an absence of any strongly prohibitive environmental sensitivity There are also many legal, economic and other social considerations, such as predominant marine spatial designations, public acceptability and regional political agendas, that need to be both understood and aligned correctly before project development justifies commercial pursuit. The many risks associated with these non-technical factors are multiplied when considering less mature MRE technologies such as wave, tidal and floating wind, and their higher associated costs (e.g. design liability, insurance, deployment). Additionally, remote and peripheral regions see complicating factors arise from a range of geographical limitations on accessibility, communications, skills/employment difficulties and other potentially problematic logistics (Trama TecnoAmbiental et al., 2012). Cumulatively, the hurdles associated with MRE commercialisation in remote and peripheral regions can be substantial. Opportunities for cost and risk reduction within the development and market growth stage can enable or block successful deployment. This paper identifies some of the opportunities for collaborative learning and cost reduction emerging from a two stage stakeholder consultation process carried out in Cornwall, UK and Finist{\`{e}}re, France. This covers opportunities within the application of legal and regulatory compliance, innovation and business support policy, social and educational policy opportunities and the identification of specific technology areas that (from a non-technical perspective) present opportunities for collaboration and exploitation for mutual benefit, such as complementary assets or relative levels of technology maturity. It should be noted that the opportunities identified are not certainties. They have ‘potential' in that if adopted they may reduce the overall non-technical hurdles (and therefore risk and cost as mentioned earlier) to commercialisation of MRE within both regions, and relative to being overcome separately. This is likely only if adequate funding, time and commitment is provided, and most likely with the leadership and support of key public sector bodies.},

It considers arrays of point absorbers with linear power take-off equipment, grouped in a relatively small number of devices. Initially a frequency domain analysis is undertaken using a post-processing code which estimates the global power absorption for different layouts based on WAMIT hydrodynamic coefficients. The study presents the influence of the layout configuration and the spacing between devices on the overall array performance, using both, a frequency domain and a stochastic approach. Ultimately, a few configurations are selected and a more detailed study is carried out using a time domain model still under development, which allows the analysis of the motion time series and the instantaneous power production, and in a future stage will enable the inclusion of nonlinearities such as the nonlinear power take-off behaviour, drag forces and the nonlinear mooring loads.},

abstract = {As marine renewable energy developers aim to scale up their devices, the greater removal of energy from propagating waves increases the potential for environmental impacts at the coastline. Quantifying the impact of energy extraction on sensitive areas has proved a contentious issue and a source of ill feeling between developers and stakeholders. However, local stakeholders concerned about the potential impacts of marine renewable energy developments are often connected to specific coastal locations. These include ecologically sensitive areas, and recreational areas such as those used for surfing. Careful consideration of device placement may limit the severity of impacts on these locations. Rather than quantifying the impacts on the coastline, this paper demonstrates an analytical method for calculating exclusion windows for coastal features using a surfing case study from the West coast of Orkney. Geographical areas through which waves that impact on sensitive areas are highlighted, and the implications of avoiding development in these areas are discussed. This methodology is seen as a tool to allow constructive discussions between stakeholders and developers, enabling WEC devices to coexist near sensitive coastal climates, and circumventing a contentious issue that can hinder project development.},

Modifications to the airfoil characteristics and the momentum portion of classical blade element-momentum theory are given that improve correlation with measured data. Improvement is particularly evident at low tip-speed ratios where aerodynamic stall can occur as the blade experiences high angles of attack. Output power calculated using the modified theory is compared with measured data for several large wind turbines. These wind turbines range in size from the DOE/NASA 100 kW Mod-0 (38 m rotor diameter) to the 2000 kW Mod-1 (61 m rotor diameter).

abstract = {Wave energy devices are often located in intermediate or shallow water close to the free water surface where the wave exposure is extreme. The structures typically consist of large thin curved plates, spherical shells, or cylindrical structures which are sensitive to pressure loads. The lack of proper methods to calculate design pressure distributions has led to structural failures such as buckling in the shells in wave energy prototypes. As a step towards understanding the complex loading from high order non-linear waves, this paper presents a practical approach to estimate wave excitation forces accounting for both non-linearity and diffraction effects. The method is validated by laboratory experiments using a hemispherical point absorber with a 6-axis force transducer, but the technique is believed to be applicable for most types of submerged or semi-submerged floating devices. The applied method is based on calculation of a peak force coefficient defined as experimentally measured forces on the structure divided by forces estimated by the chosen theoretical method. Methods used include an integration of the undisturbed wave pressure over the surface of the structure, corresponding to the Froude-Krylov force, and a numerical solution to linear potential diffraction theory. Since the two methods have mutual limitations in describing higher order waves and diffraction, a combination of the two will be introduced.},

abstract = {The power potential of a fence of tidal turbines depends on the mass flux through the array and the variation of the flow velocity within the array. The shallow water equations (SWE) are often used to analyse the power potential of a site, where the turbine array is modelled as a region of enhanced flow resistance. This method leads to errors in the power extracted by the turbine array as the velocity at the turbine plane, and therefore the power, is incorrect because the variation in flow speed across the array is not modelled by the shallow water model. This paper develops a correction based on a LinearMomentum Actuator Disk Theory (LMADT) representation of the turbine array which equates the thrust between the simulated array and the analytically modelled turbine array. The power extracted by the turbine array can then be correctly evaluated, which is shown to be less than the erroneous power calculated from the simulated array flow velocity. The corrected shallow water flow model can be used to solve the more relevant reverse problem of the thrust required to deliver a given level of power generation. It is found that the thrust required, and thus overall energy removal (including wake mixing) from the flow is always higher for a given output power when the relationship between thrust and power is correctly modelled.},

Both wind and wave energy converters are subject to a degree of intermittency and fluctuating outputs. However, this cross-technology intermittency is not synchronized and can occur at different times. The theoretical energy potential of the wave and wind energy resources, as established under the Hebridean Marine Energy Futures programme for an area off the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, is described in this paper for a one year period and the projected outputs of industrial wind turbines and hypothetical wave energy converters in the near shore and offshore are investigated and correlated. Results show that the combination of wind and wave energy converters results in a reduced fluctuation of energy supply to the electrical network and a more balanced system. It is further demonstrated that although cross technology grid sharing can offer a remedy in the short to medium term, maximum energy yield can only be achieved by an electrical grid network capable to carry 100{\%} of the energy generated at any given time.},

abstract = {Accuracy of the acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV) is evaluated in this paper. Simultaneous measurements of open-channel flow were undertaken in a 17-m flume using an ADV and a laser Doppler velocimeter. Flow velocity records obtained by both instruments are used for estimating the true (‘‘ground truth'') flow characteristics and the noise variances encountered during the experimental runs. The measured values are compared with estimates of the true flow characteristics and values of variance (?u?2?, ?w?2?) and covariance (?u?w??) predicted by semiempirical models for open-channel flow. The analysis showed that the ADV sensor can measure mean velocity and Reynolds stress within 1{\%} of the estimated true value. Mean velocities can be obtained at distances less than 1 cm from the boundary, whereas Reynolds stress values obtained at elevations greater than 3 cm above the bottom exhibit a variation that is in agreement with the predictions of the semiempirical models. Closer to the boundary, the measured Reynolds stresses deviate from those predicted by the model, probably due to the size of the ADV sample volume. Turbulence spectra computed using the ADV records agree with theoretical spectra after corrections are applied for the spatial averaging due to the size of the sample volume and a noise floor. The noise variance in ADV velocity records consists of two terms. One is related to the electronic circuitry of the sensor and its ability to resolve phase differences, whereas the second is flow related. The latter noise component dominates at rapid flows. The error in flow measurements due to the former noise term depends on sensor velocity range setting and ranges from ?0.95 to ?3.0 mm s?1. Noise due to shear within the sample volume and to Doppler broadening is primarily a function of the turbulence dissipation parameter. Noise variances calculated using spectral analysis and the results of the ground truthing technique are compared with theoretical estimates of noise.},

abstract = {One of the most important aspects of the environmental impact of a tidal turbine is its effect on sediment transport from the seabed into the flow downstream of the device. Previous computational studies of the environmental impact of tidal turbines have focused predominantly on large-scale one and two dimensional modelling. Resolution of the three-dimensional nature of the flow through the rotor of the turbine proves however to be crucial if the mechanism whereby these devices entrain sediment from the seabed is to be properly understood. The physics of sediment transport due to the rotor of a tidal turbine in a tidal current have been investigated using high resolution threedimensional computational simulations of the hydrodynamics of the rotor wake. In the process of extracting power from the tidal stream, each blade of the turbine trails a sheet of vorticity into the flow. These sheets roll up immediately behind the rotor to form a sequence of concentrated vortex filaments, yielding a helical structure to the wake as it convects into the flow downstream of the turbine. This structure interacts with the seabed, resulting in localised increases in bed shear stress that are responsible for the entrainment of sediment into the flow. The ordered structure of the rotor wake decays rapidly downstream of the device, and, if the inflow varies with depth, the wake lifts clear of the seabed some distance downstream of the turbine. As a result, the region of elevated excess bed shear stress, and thus the direct impact of the turbine on the seabed, is confined to an area that extends no further than two rotor diameters downstream of the turbine. The mean of the spatially-averaged excess bed shear stress was found to be proportional to the inflow velocity at the rotor hub, suggesting that tidal turbines are responsible for an entrainment of sediment into the flow that occurs in phase with the tidal cycle.},

abstract = {The impact of blade roughness and biofouling on the performance of a two-bladed horizontal axis marine current turbine was investigated experimentally and numerically. A 0.8 m diameter rotor (1/25th scale) with a NACA 63-618 cross section was tested in a towing tank. The torque, thrust and rotational speed were measured in the range 5 {\textless} lambda {\textless} 11 (lambda = tip speed ratio). Three different cases were tested: clean blades, artificially fouled blades and roughened blades. The performance of the turbine was predicted using blade element momentum theory and validated using the experimental results. The lift and drag curves necessary for the numerical model were obtained by testing a 2D NACA 63-618 aerofoil in a wind tunnel under clean and roughened conditions. The numerical model predicts the trends that were observed in the experimental data for roughened blades. The artificially fouled blades did not adversely affect turbine performance, as the vast majority of the fouling sheared off. The remaining material improved the performance by delaying stall to higher angles of attack and allowing measurements at lower lambda than were attainable using the clean blades. The turbine performance was adversely affected in the case of roughened blades, with the power coefficient (C-P) versus lambda curve significantly offset below that for the clean case. The maximum C-P for this condition was 0.34, compared to 0.42 for the clean condition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Nowadays, more attention was paid on better use of ocean energy all over the world. In the process of development and utilization of ocean energy, lots of tidal power farms are under construction for the purpose of commercial application. In order to gain more tidal energy, one of the best ways is to put multiple tidal turbines together to make tidal power farm. These turbines in tidal power farm are not isolated, they are interacted each other. Tidal current turbine array which is consisted of a large number of turbines will have more effect on the flow field around it, and then have influent on energy capture efficiency. Among all the parameters that have impact on turbines in tidal farms, the rotation direction of turbine rotor has influent on the performance of turbines. In this paper, by using the method of numerical simulation, two kinds of blade models for bi-directional turbine were established to study how rotation direction of rotor affects the flow field and the force on blades. This will help us find the optimized layout of turbines in tidal power farm, to make good use of the beneficial effect between turbines and reduce the adverse factors, and this synergistic effect will lead to the turbines capture more power than that of the same number of isolated machines. This research work in this paper will provide theoretical basis for the construction of tidal power station in the future.},

When planning for the installation of an array of tidal stream energy converters one of the key financial aims is to minimise the LCOE to increase the profitability of the array. Using GH's expertise and a flexible, in-house techno-economic modelling tool, the significant contributions to cost of energy throughout the lifetime of a hypothetical tidal farm are determined. It is shown that the greatest contributors to the LCOE are the capital cost of devices and the year-on-year cost of maintaining the turbines. Thus, a significant amount of the cost for a tidal energy project results from the device design stage and particularly during concept design. The device concept design is then explored in further detail to identify the impact of high level parameters such as rotor size and power rating on the lifetime cost of energy results. The trends of LCOE with concept design parameter are presented. It is also found that reducing the energy yield to increase reliability may be beneficial to the LCOE.},

TPLs provide an integral technology assessment of all cost and performance drivers grouped into the five high level categories of acceptability, power conversion efficiency, availability, capital expenditure (CapEx) and lifecycle operational expenditure (OpEx), while broadly inversely related to cost of energy (CoE). Following previous introduction of the TPLs in [1], used alongside the Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) in form of the TRL–TPL–Matrix visualisation providing a useful means for the evaluation, comparison and discussion of different research technology development trajectories over the technology readiness and performance levels plane, this paper recaps on the motivation for introduction and use of TPLs and extends their description through their fundamental principles. TPLs are applicable at all development stages over all TRLs and the associated techno-economical WEC technology assessments are described over a range of TPLs. The value of technology is discussed with respect to investability while under development and marketability when at product stage. It is shown that the combined consideration of both TRL and TPL are of the essence in order to a) identify requirements of WEC technology for successful entry and survival in the electricity market and b) assess actual value technology under development when crucial investment and funding decisions are made.},

Part I deals with the viscous effects while the extreme sea conditions will be presented in Part II. The numerical simulations are performed using the commercial CFD package ANSYS FLUENT. The comparison between numerical results and experimental measurements shows excellent agreement in terms of capturing local features of the flow as well as the dynamics of the device. A series of simulations is conducted with various wave conditions, flap configurations and model scales to investigate the viscous and scaling effects on the device. It is found that the diffraction/radiation effects dominate the device motion and that the viscous effects are negligible for wide flaps.},

abstract = {Although used for the station-keeping of offshore equipment for several decades, synthetic ropes have only recently been used for marine renewable energy (MRE) devices. The fundamental mooring load differences between these two applications necessitate the detailed quantification of mooring component performance. Of particular importance for lifecycle analysis, installation and maintenance operations is the evolution of synthetic component performance over time due to load history and fatigue mechanisms. Changes to the stiffness and damping properties of these materials will affect the global response of the device if the mooring system and device responses are closely coupled. To address these uncertainties, tension experiments have been conducted on Nylon parallel-stranded rope samples at IFREMER as part of a MERiFIC (Marine Energy in Far Peripheral and Island Communities) consortium. Measurements are reported from tests involving three new samples subjected to a mixed creep/recovery and harmonic loading regime. Different initial bedding-in levels are used to investigate the influence of load history on the immediate quasi-static and dynamic properties of the rope. For the load regimes studied, it is found that the rope condition with respect to the load-strain characteristic has a strong influence on the performance of the line.},

abstract = {Planar self-calibration methods have become standard for stereo PIV to correct misalignments between laser light sheet and calibration plane. Computing cross-correlation between images from camera 1 and 2 taken at the same time, non-zero disparity vectors indicate rotational and translational misalignments relative to the coordinate system defined by a calibration plate. This approach works well for thin light sheets but fails for extended volumes recorded in 3D-PTV or tomographic PIV experiments. Here it is primarily necessary to correct calibration errors leading to triangulation errors in 3D-PTV or in degraded tomographic volume reconstruction. Tomographic PIV requires calibration accuracies of a fraction of a pixel throughout the complete volume, which is difficult to achieve experimentally. A new volumetric self-calibration technique has been developed based on the computation of the 3D position of matching particles by triangulation as in 3D-PTV. The residual triangulation error (‘disparity') is then used to correct the mapping functions for all cameras. A statistical clustering method suitable for dense particle images has been implemented to find correct disparity map peaks from true particle matches. Disparity maps from multiple recordings are summed for better statistics. This self-calibration scheme has been validated using several tomographic PIV experiments improving the vector quality significantly. The relevance for other 3D velocimetry methods is discussed.},

abstract = {A new technique (fat-sheet Tomo-PIV) is presented to measure instantaneously the full 3D- velocity gradient tensor in a light sheet plane, which is an important quantity e.g. for turbulent research. So far this tensor has been measured by dual-plane Stereo-PIV, fast scanning PIV (only for slow flows), and with less spatial resolution by 3D-PTV and digital holographic PIV. The experimental setup of Tomo-PIV is similar to Stereo-PIV but using three cameras and a somewhat thicker sheet. First the intensities of all voxels within the light sheet are reconstructed using a MART tomographic reconstruction algorithm (Elsinga et.al. 2005). Then the volume is split into two parts, z 0, and for each part a three-dimensional cross- correlation is done to compute two planes of 3C-vectors and all 9 components of the velocity gradient tensor. First the accuracy of the proposed method computing only a single vector plane is compared to standard Stereo-PIV using synthetic and real data. It is quantified how the spatial resolution and accuracy of Stereo- PIV is limited by the laser sheet thickness and in-plane and out-of-plane flow gradients due to non-identical interrogation volumes for both cameras. Tomo-PIV does not suffer from this limitation, but has other error sources mainly from imperfect reconstruction due to optical defects. For synthetic data Tomo-PIV has less errors and better spatial resolution than Stereo-PIV especially for thicker light sheet needed e.g. for cross- flow measurements. For real images Stereo-PIV was about a factor of 2 better in low gradient regions. Then it is shown for synthetic and real data how Tomo-PIV can compute two closely-spaced vectors fields and the 3D-strain tensor using a thicker light sheet. Using synthetically generated images the out-of-plane gradients are measured within 5-10{\%}, for real images within 10-20{\%}. This is similar to what has been reported for dual-plane Stereo-PIV requiring 4 cameras and two double-pulse lasers, where the errors depend strongly on accurate laser sheet profile and position determination.},

abstract = {Abstract The use of acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) to measure turbulent parameters via the variance method involves uncertainties due to instrument noise and flow-related errors in measurement. For weak flows, the uncertainty in Reynolds stress measurements arises mainly from instrument noise and is proportional to the square of the velocity standard deviation, while the uncertainty in the corresponding estimates of the rate of production of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is proportional to the cube of the velocity standard deviation. For stronger flows, the principal determining parameter is the number of individual independent velocity measurements over which the variance is calculated. These results are validated by detailed analyses of two datasets from an RD Instruments 1.2-MHz Workhorse ADCP, using a ping rate of 2 Hz with ensemble averaging at 0.5 Hz, and a ping rate of 10 Hz with ensemble averaging at 1 Hz, respectively. While increasing ping rate generally reduces the effects of instrument noise, it will not alleviate the influence of flow-related noise once the sampling interval is less than the autocovariance time scale of the turbulence. Using the fast ping rate, the uncertainty in the Reynolds stress due to instrument noise is reduced by a factor of more than 3 to ?0.02 Pa; in higher energy environments there is a reduction in the uncertainty of about 30{\%}. The observational and theoretical estimates for the reduction in the uncertainty using the fast ping rate are in good agreement.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper evaluates the performance of a newly developed free-falling microstructure profiler. The instrument is equipped with standard turbulence sensors for measuring turbulent velocity shear and temperature gradient, as well as bio-optical sensors for measuring in situ chlorophyll and turbidity variations. Simultaneous measurements with this profiler and an acoustic Doppler velocimeter were carried out in a flow tank, and data from both instruments agreed well. Turbulence spectra computed from both instruments agreed with the Kolmogorov inertial subrange hypothesis over approximately two decades in wavenumber space. Data from field tests conducted with the profiler showed that turbulence spectra measured in situ agreed with the empirical Nasmyth spectrum when corrections were made for the shear probe's spatial averaging. Dissipation rates as low as 5 ? 10?10 W kg?1 were resolved when certain precautions were taken to avoid spectral bias caused by instrument vibrations. By assuming a universal form of the turbulence spectrum, turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates below 5 ? 10?10 W kg?1 can be estimated. The optical sensors resolved centimeter-scale structures of in vivo fluorescence and backscatter in field measurements.},

abstract = {Further understanding the small scale coherent structures which occur in high Reynolds number turbulence would be of enormous benefit. Therefore, the aim of the current project was to make well resolved three-dimensional flow measurements of the mixing flow between counter rotating impellers, using Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (TPIV).

TPIV software was developed, with a novel approach permitting a significant reduction in processing time, and a series of numerical accuracy studies contributing to the fundamental understanding of this new technique. Basic flow characterisation determined the local isotropy, homogeneity and expected Reynolds number scaling. A favourable comparison between planar PIV and TPIV increased confidence in the latter, which was used to assess the dynamics and topology of the dissipation scale structures.

In support of previous investigations similar topology, strain rate alignment, scale-invariance, and clustering behaviours are demonstrated. Correlated high enstrophy and dissipation regions occur in the periphery of larger structures, resulting in intermittency. Geometry characterisation indicates a predominance of tube-like structures, which are observed to form from larger ribbon-like structures through unsteady breakdown and vortex roll-up. Significant correlation between intermittent fields of dissipation and enstrophy describe the fine scales effects. These relationships should pave the way for more accurate models, capable of relating small scales and large scales during the prediction of dynamically important quantities.},

abstract = {A nominally-zero-pressure-gradient incompressible boundary layer over a smooth flat plate was simulated for a continuous momentum thickness Reynolds number rangeof80{\textless}Re$\theta$ {\textless}940. Transition which is completed at approximately Re$\theta$ =750 was triggered by intermittent localized disturbances arising from patches of isotropic turbulence introduced periodically from the free stream at Re$\theta$ =80. Streamwise pressure gradient is quantified with several measures and is demonstrated to be weak. Blasius boundary layer is maintained in the early transitional region of 80{\textless}Re$\theta$ {\textless}180 within which the maximum deviation of skin friction from the theoretical solution is less than 1{\%}. Mean and second-order turbulence statistics are compared with classic experimental data, and they constitute a rare DNS dataset for the spatially developing zero-pressure-gradient turbulent flat-plate boundary layer. Our calculations indicate that in the present spatially developing low-Reynolds-number turbulent flat-plate boundary layer, total shear stress mildly overshoots the wall shear stress in the near- wall region of 2–20 wall units with vanishing normal gradient at the wall. Overshoots as high as 10{\%} across a wider percentage of the boundary layer thickness exist in the late transitional region. The former is a residual effect of the latter. The instantaneous flow fields are vividly populated by hairpin vortices. This is the first time that direct evidence (in the form of a solution of the Navier–Stokes equations, obeying the statistical measurements, as opposed to synthetic superposition of the structures) shows such dominance of these structures. Hairpin packets arising from upstream fragmented $\Lambda$ structures are found to be instrumental in the breakdown of the present boundary layer bypass transition.},

abstract = { We adopt a view that suggests that many problems of image restoration are probably geometric in character and admit the following initial linear formulation: The original{\textless}tex{\textgreater}f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}is a vector known a priori to belong to a linear subspace{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}b{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}of a parent Hilbert space{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal H{\}}({\textless}/tex{\textgreater}, but all that is available to the observer is its image{\textless}tex{\textgreater}P{\_}{\{}a{\}} f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}, the projection of{\textless}tex{\textgreater}f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}onto a known linear subspace{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}a{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}(also in{\textless}tex{\textgreater}cal H{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}).  1) Find necessary and sufficient conditions under which{\textless}tex{\textgreater}f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}is uniquely determined by{\textless}tex{\textgreater}P{\_}{\{}a{\}} f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}and 2) find necessary and sufficient conditions for the stable linear reconstruction of{\textless}tex{\textgreater}f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}from{\textless}tex{\textgreater}P{\_}{\{}a{\}} f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}in the face of noise. (In the later case, the reconstruction problem is said to be completely posed.) The answers torn out to be remarkably simple.  a){\textless}tex{\textgreater}f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}is uniquely determined by{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}a{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}iff{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}and the orthogonal complement of{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{} cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}a{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}have only the zero vector in common.   b) The reconstruction problem is completely posed iff the angle between{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}and the orthogonal complement of{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}a{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}, is greater than zero. (All angles lie in the first quadrant.)  c) In the absence of noise, there exists in both cases a) and b) an effective recursive algorithm for the recovery of{\textless}tex{\textgreater}f{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}employing only the operations of projection onto{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}b{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}and projection onto the orthogonal complement of{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\{}cal P{\}}{\_}{\{}a{\}}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}These operations define the necessary instrumentation.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computational framework to extract salient
patterns, called vortex structures, from 3D turbulent fluid flows. These
structures can be characterized as regions of dominating rotational
motion in the velocity fields and intensity concentrations in the
corresponding vorticity fields. A pointwise linear representation is
employed to approximate the kinematics of the flow field, and the fluid
motion is classified according to motion analysis or topological
patterns. The regions of vortex structures are identified as those
dominated by rotational motion or those of focus-type singularity. The
2D vortices, as a special case of 3D vortices, are detected by searching
for regions of vorticity concentrations},

@article{zhouetal1999,
abstract = {The evolution of a single hairpin vortex-like structure in the mean turbulent field of a low-Reynolds-number channel flow is studied by direct numerical simulation. The structure of the initial three-dimensional vortex is extracted from the two-point spatial correlation of the velocity field by linear stochastic estimation given a second-quadrant ejection event vector. Initial vortices having vorticity that is weak relative to the mean vorticity evolve gradually into omega-shaped vortices that persist for long times and decay slowly. As reported in Zhou, Adrian {\&} Balachandar (1996), initial vortices that exceed a threshold strength relative to the mean flow generate new hairpin vortices upstream of the primary vortex. The detailed mechanisms for this upstream process are determined, and they are generally similar to the mechanisms proposed by Smith et al. (1991), with some notable differences in the details. It has also been found that new hairpins generate downstream of the primary hairpin, thereby forming, together with the upstream hairpins, a coherent packet of hairpins that propagate coherently. This is consistent with the experimental observations of Meinhart {\&} Adrian (1995). The possibility of autogeneration above a critical threshold implies that hairpin vortices in fully turbulent fields may occur singly, but they more often occur in packets. The hairpins also generate quasi-streamwise vortices to the side of the primary hairpin legs. This mechanism bears many similarities to the mechanisms found by Brooke {\&} Hanratty (1993) and Bernard, Thomas {\&} Handler (1993). It provides a means by which new quasi-streamwise vortices, and, subsequently, new hairpin vortices can populate the near-wall layer.},

abstract = {The evolution of a symmetric pair of quasistreamwise vortical structures extracted from the two‐point correlation tensor of turbulent channel flow data by a linear stochastic estimation procedure is studied through direct numerical simulation. It is observed that an $\Omega$‐shaped hairpin vortex is formed quickly from this initial structure. Sufficiently strong hairpin vortices are observed to generate a hierarchy of secondary hairpin vortices, and the mechanism of their creation closely resembles the formation of the primary hairpin vortex. New streamwise vortices are also generated, and this process provides a means for a few vortical disturbances of adequate strength to reproduce themselves and eventually populate the near‐wall layer.},
