Turbulent Effects (Wind)
=========================

Turbulence has a wide range of effects on wind plant and operations. To help understand how turbulence impacts the
industry, we put together an 'effects selector'.

TODO - refer to the poster.

The Turbulent Effects Selector
==============================

The selector links: (D) design considerations, (S) turbulent scales, (E) physical effects and (N) the nature of the
effect. Hover your pointer over the chart. Whichever label you hover over is linked to related issues: red items affect
the item; green items are affected by it.
