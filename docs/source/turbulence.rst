Turbulence
==========

**es-flow** is aimed at characterising shear, veer and turbulence in Atmospheric and Marine Boundary Layers. The
concepts of shear and veer are well known in the wind industry, but their closely relate cousin, turbulence, is more of
a mystery.

For a thorough understanding of turbulence in the ABL, a lengthy academic career is required. But, for the less patient
among us, a few notes, recommended readings and resources are made available here - specific to the wind and tidal
stream industries.

#. :ref:`chapter-turbulence_coherent_structures`: Notes on coherent ctructures - an explanation and exploration of this author's pet subject, with some extremely pretty pictures.
#. :ref:`chapter-turbulence_wind`: The "Turbulence Selector (Wind)" - a review of the many, varied ways in which turbulence can affect plant and operations in the wind industry.
#. :ref:`chapter-turbulence_tidal`: The "Turbulence Selector (Tidal)" - the same, but for the tidal stream industry.
