Turbulent Effects (Tidal)
=========================

Turbulence has a wide range of effects on tidal stream plant and operations. The Turbulence in Marine Environments (TiME)
project resulted in guidance for the tidal stream power industry, giving a comprehensive review of:

#. Techniques for measuring turbulence in tidal streams.
#. Characterisation of turbulence (including a description of several of the relations in **es-flow**).
#. Different turbulent effects that impact operations.

The Turbulent Effects Selector
==============================

One output of the TiME project was the "turbulent effects selector".
The selector links: (D) design considerations, (S) turbulent scales, (E) physical effects and (N) the nature of the
effect. Hover your pointer over the chart. Whichever label you hover over is linked to related issues: red items affect
the item; green items are affected by it.
