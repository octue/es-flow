Origins
=======

EnvironmentSTUDIO flow began as an internal tool at OAS, for characterising turbulence at tidal power sites.
It was originated in MATLAB (then called the 'Flow Characterisation Suite'), and grew incrementally.

As the move was made toward object orientation, and usage increased toward requiring a production version, that could be
deployed without requiring expensive MATLAB licenses, EnvironmentSTUDIO flow project was started in C++.

Gradually, capability is being ported from MATLAB (the original repo having been subsumed within this project and now
being slowly deprecated).
