%MARS Multiresolution Analysis for Reynolds Stress
% Uses a time series of u,v,w velocity data at a point to determine
% Reynolds Stresses via multiresolution analysis.
%
% Time series data must be monotonic (uniformly spaced)

% Plot the time series
raiseFigure('MARS input timeseries')

% Check that data is uniformly spaced
