function [y, Fout]=SincResample(xin, npoints, Fin, shift, mode)
% SincResample resamples signals to arbitrary lengths/frequencies and can
% timeshift them.
%
% SincResample can be faster than INTERP or RESAMPLE when X contains many
% relatively short data columns.
%
%
% Example:
% [Y, FOUT]=SincResample(X, NPOINTS, FIN, SHIFT, MODE)
%
% X is a vector or M x N  matrix where each column represents a signal.
% NPOINTS is the number of points required in each column after
% resampling.
% FIN (if supplied) is the sampling rate in X (default 1 samples/sec).
% SHIFT (if supplied) is the time (in seconds) to shift the points at which
% interpolation will be done (default 0). SHIFT should be between ±(1/Fin).
% SHIFT can be used to synchronize signals separated by up to ±(1/Fin)
% in time.
% MODE (if supplied) is a string:
%           'sinc' to use a hamming-windowed sinc function (default)
%           'lanczos' for a 3-lobed Lanczos function
%
% Y is the resulting M x NPOINTS matrix formed by resampling. The time
% of the first sample in each column of Y is shifted by SHIFT seconds
% relative to those in X.
% FOUT is the effective sample rate for output Y (normalised to FIN=1 if
% FIN is not supplied on input).
%
% If X is a bandlimited (filtered) signal containing components at
% DC - 0.5Fs where Fs is the sample rate, SincResample will return
% the signal that would have been seen with a higher sampling rate
% (and the same filter settings). The algorithm depends on the fact that
% the bandlimited signal is completely defined when sampling at Fs.
%
% SincResample returns the data convolved with a set of  time-shifted
% windowed sinc functions, one for each of the samples [1..size(x,1)]
% in the input signal. End-effects are reduced by adding a reflected 
% and mirrored copy of the data at the beginning and end of each column
% before resampling.
%
% Note that points at the end of Y (and/or beginning if SHIFT is negative)
% will be extrapolated beyond the boundaries of X.
%
% SincResample is a generalization of the method used in Blanche &
% Swindale (2006).
%
% See also e.g. interp & resample (in the Signal Processing Toolbox) and 
% the sinc online documentation.
